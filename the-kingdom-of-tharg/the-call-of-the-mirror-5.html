            <div class="col-lg"><p>"It must be the place then - the pit in Tharg's palace was directly over the Mirror. They cast me right into it!"</p>
<p>"Indeed. Well, friend Calir. What is your plan now?"</p>
<p>Calir looked puzzled for a moment and then considered this question. Aevum felt a touch of sympathy for the fellow. He had clearly been so focused on getting here that he hadn't given much thought to what they would do when they arrived.</p>
<p>"Well, come to think of it, I've been so focused on our journey that - it's strange isn't it? - I haven't given any thought to what we might do when we got here!"</p>
<p>Aevum smiled to himself.</p>
<p>"But, I suppose the original plan still holds. Here we are, armed with the curse of the Dark Mirror, able to move for minutes in an instant of their time. We can saunter in, take the measure of the place, find my friends and then carry them out one by one - all before Tharg or his cronies have even noticed that we've arrived! What say you, my good man?"</p>
<p>"Your plan is indeed a good one, friend Calir. Let us hope it is as easy as you say."</p>
<p>With this, Calir nodded once and crested the ridge the had been crouched behind. He led the way down to the small clearing dominated by the fortress and soon gained the wall.</p>
<p>"Let's walk around it until we find the entrance I remember."</p>
<p>Aevum inclined his head and followed the man in a careful circumnavigation of the palace. They'd made it around three of the four walls, when they came to a broad avenue carved out of the ice. It led from the wilderness of the ice sheet straight to the wall and under a broad archway. The teeth of a portcullis were visible poking out from beneath the rim of the arch and light was visible beyond the tunnel's span.</p>
