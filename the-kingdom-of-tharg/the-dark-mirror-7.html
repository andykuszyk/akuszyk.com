                <p>"Who summons me from my deep slumber? What are you to awaken my mighty power! Speak now or I shall tear you down to an even deeper hell!"</p>
<p>Somehow even after all of their practising and rehearsals, Calir wasn't quite sure who was supposed to answer her. His palms were sweating with fear about the upcoming sacrifice, even though all he had to do was draw a slither of blood across his hand in a ceremonial gesture. Still, was he supposed to step up now and offer her his blood? Before he could take the hesitant step he was preparing for, Aevum stepped forward himself, casting back his hood and spreading his arms wide.</p>
<p>"It is I, Aevum of the Midnight Dark, seer of the Crystal Night and Dark Mage of Power! Hear me, oh mighty reflective one, and accept this sacrifice for our passage to other places and times!"</p>
<p>As if this was a completely normal occurrence, Aevum then gestured to Calir to step forward. He did so and held out his damp palm towards Aevum. Raising his right arm, with a small dull blade clutched in his hand, Aevum continued.</p>
<p>"I shed the blood of a life not yet lived, of time not yet spent, of a journey not yet over. Take this blood and let it slake your thirst!"</p>
<p>With this, he quickly brought the knife to bear against Calir's slippery palm and, making Calir jump with its suddenness, drew it across leaving a line of dark red behind. Aevum mimed clenching his fist and waving it over the ground. As soon as Calir realised what he meant, he copied the gesture until a few drops of his blood dripped from his hand to land in a scatter-gun pattern on the floor. Almost immediately the howling air slackened, the temperature rose slightly and a somewhat more relaxed voice filled the air.</p>
<p>"Mmmm, I accept the sacrifice. When would you bid me take you?"</p>
<p>Aevum looked across at Calir and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Home! Back home please your, er, shininess," Aevum shot Calir a questioning look, who shrugged helplessly. "Domum Continent please, or thereabouts."</p>
<p>The air continued to calm, the temperature continued to rise, and the voice became almost maternal.</p>
