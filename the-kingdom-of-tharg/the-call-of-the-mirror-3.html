            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>"Leave me? But why my good man? Whatever would you do without me? We're comrades, fellow prisoners, fellow journeymen on a quest!"</p>
<p>Aevum nodded in agreement and allowed himself the smallest smile. Calir thought he looked sad.</p>
<p>"Indeed, friend Calir, indeed. But, when the time comes, you will understand."</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>And so began the second great part of their journey. Except this was longer and more arduous than the first. This time they were walking back into the interior of the ice continent, further than they had gone before and towards the source of dark magic that covered the land, not away from it. But, Calir found the trek easier, somehow. The mage had pointed out to him that he had forgotten his warm clothes and he had been surprised and amused to realise it.</p>
<p>"Oh! I suppose I have!" he chuckled, "Well, I must be getting a stronger constitution. All this cold air is good for a man, you know!"</p>
<p>He shrugged it off without a second thought, unlike Aevum who was deeply troubled by this change in his companion. As before, they needed little rest and rarely stopped for sleep. They ate nothing at all and, being full of bread at the beginning of their journey, suffered neither hunger nor thirst. Again, unlike their outward journey when this was a source of constant complaints from Calir, this time he didn't notice at all. It was Aevum, who was used to this kind of thing himself, who noticed the change in Calir.</p>
<p>"Where is his good natured appetite? His thirst for good ale? Where is his desire to be home besides a fireplace?"</p>
<p>These questions and more he asked himself as the journeyed further and further into the Ice Continent. They walked for days and days, slowly picking their way across the shattered ice and between the jagged glaciers. Often they would have to back-track for half a day or more, because they stumbled across a great crevasse that was impassable or a shear cliff of brilliant, blue ice that was impossible to climb. However, they did make progress towards their destination and little by little, though Calir couldn't have said by how much, they approached Tharg's palace.</p>
<p>The mage was guiding them by an inner sense of the source of the Dark Mirror's magic. Whenever he wasn't sure what direction they should take, he sat down in the snow and allowed himself to sink into a trance that had his mind ebbing and flowing with the currents of sorcery around him. After each of these trances, he had a strong sense of where the Dark Mirror's power was emanating from and could easily point them in the right direction. Without Aevum's powers, Calir would soon have been lost in the icy wilderness. But, as it was, he felt safe and confident in his friend's guidance and - missing neither sleep nor food nor ale - was happy to pass the days trekking in the mage's wake.</p>
