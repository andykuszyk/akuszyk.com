<p>"It strikes me now that we may have been swept aside by these torrents of time from the moment we first found ourselves in that cell beneath the ice. From the very first I suspect that time was passing more slowly for the outside world than for us and that that was part of the price we had to pay for our escape - to continue to endure those rapids."</p>
<p>"Then from the time I was cast into that pit....until the moment we arrived back at these shores...?"</p>
<p>"Very little time has passed at all, for the rest of the world."</p>
<p>During this exchange, Calir had been unwittingly retreating from Aevum's words towards the baker's counter. With this last, he bumped into it from behind and sank to his feet. He sat there on the floor, bewildered and overwhelmed. He couldn't take it in, what did it all mean?</p>
<p>"So that means...?"</p>
<p>"If you are thinking of your companions, friend Calir, as I would guess that you are - that means that they are still in the clutches of King Tharg and, for them, barely a few hours may have passed."</p>
<p>This news broke Calir's stupor and he was suddenly animated again, leaping to his feet.</p>
<p>"Why, that's splendid news!"</p>
<p>"Splendid?" returned Aevum, for the first time looking confused during their conversation.</p>
