<h2>A Doorway of Doorways</h2>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>Inside, the room was wide and low. The stone of the walls was darker than the sandstone without and was marbled with veins of black and grey. The floor was paved with ill-fitting slabs, which sloped this way and that in an uneven surface that was a stark contrast to the smooth, yellow floor of outside. The stones themselves were dark and smooth, pitted and rounded as if they had been trodden by crowds for centuries. Calir didn't need to be an archaeologist to see that this room was much older than the rest of the fortress. This was its inner sanctum and it was almost as if the palace outside had been built around this room as a temple around a shrine.</p>
<p>Now that he was inside, he could clearly see where the other-worldly light was coming from. Arranged along the wall he had just stepped through, facing back towards the hall he had come from, were a set of eight doorways. There were four on either side of the intricate entrance through which he had come, although each was much smaller - barely large enough for a man to walk though. Each was built out of simple, black stone, with blockey frames that spoke of an ancient construction. However, the most interesting thing about the doorways was the doors themselves. Rather than housing aged wooden beams like the entrance to the room, each door was suffused with a blue glow that emanated from its edges and spread out into the room. In the centre of the doorways, the blue glow gave way to a slightly transparent scene that was different from door to door. Calir approached the first of the doors, on his right, and squinted into the light that was at once bright in the dullness of the room and hard to see at the same time. In the centre of the door, he could just make out what looked like a meadow. He looked closer and saw that the field of wild flowers seemed to be swaying gently in a breeze that he could not feel.</p>
<p>"Incredible!"</p>
<p>He reached out towards the doorway but, before touching it, checked himself and moved on to the next door. This next one was a stark mountainside - rocky with patches of snow and ice and not a hint of vegetation in sight. The next was a bustling town square with people coming and going, seemingly oblivious to his vantage point from the doorway. And so it went on. Each of the doors depicted a different scene except that, unlike the images carved into the entrance to this room, each of the scenes was alive and in motion and - from what he could make out from beneath the glowing light - looked perfectly real.</p>
<p>On the back wall, immediately opposite the great doors through which he had entered, was a single, solitary chair. More like a throne, he thought. It was raised on a dais and had wide arms and a tall back. It was built of the same aged and smoothed stone as the rest of the room and, when Calir investigated more closely, even had the imprint of a seated man worn into the seat.</p>
<p>Calir looked around quickly, suddenly feeling as if he shouldn't be doing what he was about to do, and sat down quickly in the chair. He felt like a child surrounded by the great arms and the back that rose behind him above his head - not to mention that he had to lift himself up on to the seat so his feet were no longer touching the floor. But, it was comfortable and he relaxed, leaning back into the chair.</p>
<p>"Ah! Not bad for a seat made of rock! Not bad at all!"</p>
<p>A sly smile crossed his face and for several moments he forgot his current predicament and his entire reason for being there. He was filled with a satisfying mix of pride and arrogance, as if he'd won a mighty battle by sitting on that throne and was waiting for his courtiers to pay their respects. This feeling had barely begun before it was gone again and he was left feeling small, embarrassed and even more alone that before. Just a small man sat in a big chair, with not a soul to comfort him and not a friend in sight. With this sudden up-welling of self-pity, he pulled up his bare legs and curled up in the middle of the seat. He closed his eyes and hugged himself and for the first time in weeks - months even - he fell soundly asleep and knew no more.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>When he came to, it was to the sound of a shuffling and scuffling. As soon as he realised what he was hearing, he started and jumped out of the throne. He had become so accustomed to the silence of the place, that this new sound was threatening and dangerous. Beneath him, about halfway between himself and the wall of doorways, was a goat. It was licking at its side and was the source of all the noise.</p>
