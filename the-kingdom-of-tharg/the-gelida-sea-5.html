                <p>A pause spread out between the two men and them now empty room. They stared at the dim, grey room aghast. Calir's guts rumbled.</p>
<p>"Do you think it's safe to eat?"</p>
<p>Aevum turned to face Calir, a look of horror on his face.</p>
<p>"Safe? Sorcery this dark is a rare and malevolent thing. Before your hand had reached the table, you would be doomed to the same fate as these poor souls. Eternally suffering death and decay, only to be reincarnated at the apex of your peace. No, friend Calir this is the least safe place we have seen together and we should leave at once. Your next meal will have to wait a while longer, we must reach the edge of the ice or we shall be trapped in the dead time of this place. The Dark Mirror does not let her charges go idly and it seems that she seeks to entrap us again in her iniquitous ways. Let us be gone from this place!"</p>
<p>With this, the mage turned on his heel and left the cabin, carefully but swiftly making his way back along the pitched deck to the nearest of the trailing ropes. A moment later, when the shock of these words had worn off, Calir followed as fast as he could, stumbling on the awkward angle of the ship. He was suddenly afraid of the horrific visage perpetually repeating itself around the captain's table and was desperate–more than ever–to reach the safe and pleasant shores of Domum. Slipping and sliding down the frozen ropes, they made it back to the ice. Landing with a dull thud on the mirrored sheen of the frozen sea, they disturbed the silence that ruled the glacial waves. From out here, there was no sign of the hidden malice contained within the belly of the ship. Just an old wreck of a galleon, held fast by a timeless sea and a still air.</p>
<p>"Let us be gone," Aevum repeated in a low voice.</p>
<p>The pair struggled on and on. Calir's hunger had increased to fervent levels now and his legs were weak and trembling. He was stumbling with fatigue and beginning to suffer from the cold in his bones, not just in his hands or his feet. Aevum wasn't in a much better condition, although he was better at hiding it. He knew that their situation was becoming desperate and that they needed to reach the edge of the ice soon. He had started to entertain the idea that the Dark Mirror might have been tricking them into a path that led back towards the Ice Continent, rather than away from it and that they might end up making landfall back at the ice where they had begun. If this was happening, all was lost. They had lost the strength to go on and she would have ensnared them forever in bonds that they could not break. The mage was simply holding out hope that his instincts were worth following and that their course was true. If it was, then any minute now they should be able to see the end of the ice. The sky was lightening beyond doubt and he was sure he could feel more frequent stirrings in the air. Even if these could not be described as warm, they certainly weren't the Arctic blasts they had experienced inland, and that was a good sign. He shared none of his concerns with Calir, of course. The poor fellow was suffering terribly and a word of bad news was likely to finish him off. So, he pulled together his spirits and tried to encourage the forlorn Calir with us much vigour as he could muster.</p>
<p>"Almost there now, friend Calir. I can smell dry land from across the seas. We are surely at the end of our journey. Moments more, you'll see, and we shall reach the final ship and the edge of the ice."</p>
<p>Before he'd finished uttering these words, Calir had stopped in his tracks and raised his face with a fresh look of hope. Aevum hadn't imagined that he could be so inspiring, but perhaps the poor fool was easier to convince than he suspected.</p>
<p>"Do you hear that?"</p>
