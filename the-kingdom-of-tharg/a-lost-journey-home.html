            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>The land was warm and yellow. A rich, golden light bathed the mountain tops as Calir and his friends made their way home. The path they were wending their way down was an easy one and the evening was comfortable and still.</p>
<p>"Ah! Well, that was a wonderful celebration, Cally!"</p>
<p>"It certainly was", replied Calir, after taking a draw on his pipe. "A splendid celebration indeed."</p>
<p>"I enjoy these little excursions of yours, I do, but I enjoy returning home almost as much."</p>
<p>"Oh, Placor", chuckled Calir, "never did I meet a citizen of Domum more prepared to return home after stepping out from his door for a pipe. Even when he's still in his slippers and was just after a draft of air!"</p>
<p>"Guilty as charged Cally, guilty as charged. There really is nothing like home after all, as they say. Its nice to go away, but it's nice-the-more to return to one's door."</p>
<p>"Careful Plac, any more of that and I'll have to brand you a poet!"</p>
<p>Calir and his friends were in high spirits on the gently falling path back out of the mountains that evening. Nothing could have been further from their minds than the ordeal that was about to present itself to them, nor the hardship that they would be forced to endure before even one of them saw the pleasant townships of Domum again.</p>
<p>"Will we walk back through the night?" called one of the younger men from the rear.</p>
<p>"Not afraid of a night-time stroll through the mountains are you?" called another.</p>
<p>"Not at all! I was asking out of hope - I love a good stroll under the stars!"</p>
<p>Calir smiled to himself at the enthusiasm of his friends. He was looking forward to the return journey as much as the rest of them, possibly even more than Placor. He'd been organising these annual get-togethers for a few years now. He kept it up as much to get him out of the house as to meet up with old friends. But he really was most happy sitting on his front step on a Summer's evening, watching the gentle sunset and blowing smoke rings into the ruddy sky. Being away for a couple of nights once per year was enough to clear the cobwebs, stretch the legs and rejuvenate any ailing desires to be right back where he'd started from.</p>
<p>"Absolutely my friends, I wouldn't want to deprive you of the glory of the mountain foothills lit only by the moon and the stars. We walk to day break and fall asleep with the dawn!"</p>
<p>This exclamation was met with cheers from all corners of the group and the party moved on in high spirits and at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>As the evening progressed into night, the friends became quieter and lost in their own thoughts. Each had a glimmer of a smile on his face as he glanced amongst his fellow travellers or up at the night sky, or out at the receding mountainside bathed in moonlight. The temperature dropped as the night chilled towards midnight. No-one remarked upon this at first, but towards two in the morning, someone piped up from the middle of the group.</p>
<p>"I say! It is rather chilly, no?"</p>
<p>This remark was met with general agreement. The group stopped and, after some minutes of debate, they decided to camp up there and then, rather than waiting for dawn. They had but to unfurl their blankets, huddle up next to each other and they were all fast asleep within the space of ten minutes. Twelve friends, lined up next to each other, gently snoring.</p>
<p>It was at this time, in the dead of night, whilst all were in a deep and pleasant sleep that odd things began to happen. As the morning progressed, so did the night. Rather than a pale red beginning to colour the eastern horizon, the sky cleared into a frozen vista of stars that were fixed and unchanging. A light snow began to fall and tufts of grass here and there beside the path turned into glistening white stalks of frozen dew. Crystalline shapes formed on the scattered pools of water caught amongst the rocks as their surfaces froze. In short, the mild mountainside so full of joy and warm feelings a few hours earlier became frigid and icebound.</p>
<p>One by one, the friends of the party stirred and shivered, huddling themselves under their blankets and trying to preserve the warmth that had fled in the night.</p>
<p>"Phew, it's snowing!" came the first of the exclamations.</p>
<p>"Mercy me, it's freezing!"</p>
<p>"What's happened to the weather!"</p>
<p>"Let's move along", Calir asserted, sounding more certain than he felt. "We'd best be off in this weather - the sooner we're off, the sooner we're home."</p>
<p>It didn't take much cajoling to get the group moving and before long they were trudging down the path, stamping their feet and blowing into their hands. Except, the path was no longer leading down. In fact, it was leading back up. And, rather than descending into quiet woodland amongst dappled light, they were ascending into a fractured ice field, bare and bright in the eery light of the clear night sky. All around were ice-blues and glistening-silvers as they began to be surrounded by teeth of ice shooting this way and that. They huddled closer together and kept going, but were quiet now, each nursing his own fears about where they might have gone wrong and when they might turn round. Calir in-particular was wracked with feelings of doubt about their way back home. He knew the path to and from the celebratory mountain retreat well, having made the journey many times in the past. He often wandered in the hills by himself when he was feeling restless or wanted to escape the confines of the port-town. Never in his wildest imaginations, let alone his living experience, had he ever seen a land so desolate and hostile as this. This ice-continent was barren and unwelcoming in a way that Domum was fertile and embracing.</p>
<p>They stopped once or twice. First to don their warmer clothes - shawls, cloaks and the like. Second to wrap themselves in their night-time blankets, re-buckling their belts around the outside and stretching the tops over their heads like ill-fitted cloaks. Their toes were numb and their hands blue. They trudged on in silence and fear, wondering where they'd end up and how they'd get home.</p>
<p>Just as Calir was considering turning back and trying to re-trace their steps back out of this ice-land and onto the mountain, he spotted a sheen of yellow amongst the desert of pale blue. He started forward with a renewed energy and saw that it was a tall, sandstone wall rising over the false-horizon of a nearby serac. Calir was more excited than surprised - or suspicious - to see such an unlikely feature in such an icy wasteland as this. He was simply relieved to find a break to the rising tension of the frozen landscape and eager to find a sign that might indicate the end of this hideous detour into the unwelcoming ice.</p>
<p>"Come on friends, up ahead: looks like an old fort of some kind. Maybe we just got lost coming down the mountain!"</p>
<p>Calir's words were the first that had been uttered by anyone in the group for many hours and they shattered the silence like an icicle falling to the ground. They all hurried forward and, when the wall came fully into view, headed for the large, open door at the base. As they approached and passed through the opening, it turned out to be less of a door and more of a tunnel through the outer wall. Much like a drawbridge of old, it had a large, spiked, iron portcullis raised into the ceiling, until only the bottom protrusions were revealed. The tunnel led inside into a large hall with a vaulted stone ceiling. Tall, cathedral-like windows down either side of the hall let the pale, icy light in, but with none of it's chill. The sand-coloured walls lent their warmth to the light, turning it yellow with a cheer that one could almost believe. Everyone felt the rise in temperature, accompanied by a rise in their spirits, when they stepped into the hall. They fanned out, shrugged off their outer blankets and looked around.</p>
<p>"Wow, look at this place! Its huge!"</p>
<p>"I wonder who lived here?"</p>
<p>"At least it's warmer in here than out there!"</p>
<p>As soon as the group of friends spread out into the room, they relaxed and assumed their previous airs of cheerful optimism and good-natured friendliness. They wandered this way and that, stamping their feet and rubbing their hands as they warmed up in the hall, almost as if the golden light had the power to thaw their frozen limbs. Calir shared the general feeling of relief, but not to the point of abandon. He was still worried that they were a long way off course - even further from home - and had a niggling doubt about this oasis of shelter in the desert of ice without. There was something about it that was just too good to be true. It had been there right when they were reaching the limits of their endurance, right when they needed it - right when they were ready to turn around. He walked further into the hall, looking about him with more caution than wonder. The hall opened out into a roughly rectangular space, wider than it was deep. Calir was crossing the midpoint towards the opposite wall, which seemed to be a mezzanine level of some kind. There was a balustrade running along its top below the still significant rise to the vaulted ceilings above. A small doorway opened in the middle of this inner wall, behind which he could see the first few steps of a rising stairwell. A stairwell which presumably led to the higher floor and out onto the mezzanine. Calir had just determined to climb the stair so as to gain a better vantage of the fortress they found themselves in, when he was stopped dead in his tracks. His heart leapt in his chest, and the bottom fell out of his stomach. His already pale face turned to a picture of ice and his mind turned to the worst.</p>
<p>The sound of laughter broke into the warm echoes of the hall, dousing the idle chatter of the group with a draft of chill air. It was the sound of a predator closing in on his prey and taking amusement in doing so. Except that the laughter was akin to that of a hyena, and the hyena is no predator. The hyena is a scavenger and so was the man that appeared at the edge of the balustrade, looking down from atop the mezzanine at the folk scattered here and there, with Calir foremost amongst them. He was dressed in a ragged shirt of torn linen, with scraps of animal fur about him here and there. A rough belt of leather was slung about one shoulder and a loose loin clothe hung around his waist. His arms and legs were bare, as was much of his chest, displaying a muscular frame bound in ice-cold skin. His skin appeared ice-cold, because of its colour - a pale blue of deep, clear ice. His dishevelled hair and beard were pale to the point of albino. Even his lips appeared blue. The only colour about him, which betrayed his membership of the warm-blooded races, was in his tongue, which flicked and lolled as he spoke. It was a deep, blood red. Deeper than the blood that surely must have flowed through his veins. It was the red of old blood; of dead blood; of blood shed.</p>
<p>Silence reigned: every man in the room stopped and stared at this intruder to their peace, this claimant of their joy. The laughter trailed off and came to a stop. The man stood still, surveying the group with a easy, sly smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Well, well, well, what do we have here my boys, what do we have here..."</p>
<p>His smile deepened into a grin and his eyes came to rest on Calir. Calir's gaze was already locked onto this pale omen of frozen death. He couldn't look away. He could feel the eyes of the others glancing against him side-long, snatched away from the man above furtively in case he noticed. They were all expecting him to do something. Anything.</p>
<p>"Er, well," he cleared his through, "hello there, my good man, er, how do you do? Rather cold here isn't it?"</p>
<p>Calir gave a single, fearful chuckle that was not repeated or returned by anyone, and continued.</p>
<p>"We were just looking for our way home, actually, we're heading back to Domum Continent. I don't suppose you or your, er, boys could set us on the right path, could you?"</p>
<p>Silence prevailed now as all eyes fell on the figure leaning over the balustrade. The smile seemed to wane about his lips and his eyes grew colder still.</p>
<p>"Tharg can, my boys. Yes, Tharg will, you just wait," the last of which he uttered almost in a tone of fear or veneration, but no longer with intimidation. Now it was he who was intimidated and the rest of them felt it. They felt cold stabs of fear run through them at the name of Tharg. None of them had heard it before, but all of them felt that this name was linked to their fate in this place and that he, after all, may not be sending them on their way home. He may, in fact, be consigning them to their doom in this icy wilderness.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"Indeed he can!" came a new voice, booming out into the hall. A rich voice, deep and velvety, full-bodied and hearty, but laced with deceit and treachery. A voice to fear and respect. A voice to hide from and run from. Not a voice to be at the mercy of.</p>
<p>Muffled steps were heard descending the staircase from the mezzanine and from the doorway in the wall ahead of them, a figure appeared. He was tall and broad shouldered, similarly attired to the man at the balustrade, but with thick, entwined hair falling to his shoulders and a full beard. All of his hair was a bleached white colour, whilst his skin was a clear, translucent blue. His eyes were completely white and he walked bare-footed. He was a muscular and impressive figure, powerful in his physical presence and commanding in his gaze. Calir felt a thrill of fear as those white eyes glanced across him, surveying the hall.</p>
<p>"I am Tharg!" cried the newcomer, spreading his arms wide, "And I welcome you to my Kingdom, my Kingdom of Ice. And, I welcome you to my troop, my troop of mercenaries and marauders. I'm sure some of you will fit in quite well!"</p>
<p>Tharg was grinning now. A cruel grin, showing sharp teeth and extolling a malevolent threat that radiated from his lips and suffused the room. Calir felt colder than the ice outside as he listened to this and was filled with dread about the predicament he and his friends found themselves in.</p>
<p>"And those of you that don't," Tharg continued, looking back over this shoulder at the balcony upon which were now arranged a growing number of Tharg's followers. "And those of you that don't, will make a fine meal!"</p>
<p>With this, Tharg roared with laughter, as did the twenty of thirty bare chested, white-haired and blue-skinned thugs leering over the balcony. Some of them gnashed their teeth at the cowering friends below, others mimed tearing meat of the bone with their teeth. All took on a blood thirsty and violent aspect that left the poor men below quivering in their boots and huddling together for support.</p>
<p>As the laughter died away, Calir pulled himself together, drawing on his last scraps of courage and stepped forward, towards Tharg. This drew the King's eye, who now focused on Calir with fresh interest and a mild smile still playing about his lips.</p>
<p>"Well, sir, we thank you for your, er, welcome to your, er, mighty Ice Kingdom."</p>
<p>Tharg inclined his head in a mock bow and gestured for Calir to continue.</p>
<p>"But we respectfully decline your invitation to join your, er, band of followers. Instead, we plead for your mercy and ask that you assist us in our journey home - we're just trying to get back to Domum continent. To the warm and pleasant lands of our birth; to escape this icy desert and desolate palace and, er-"</p>
<p>Calir paused, catching himself finding himself unsure how to convince King Tharg.</p>
<p>"We just want to get home, your- your majesty," he finished awkwardly.</p>
<p>A silence descended amongst all those in the room. The men from Domum looked cautiously from Calir to Tharg and back again, hoping against hope for a swift departure from this Ice Kingdom and a speedy return to their home land. Tharg's mocking smile persisted as he slowly turned on the spot, taking in the crowd of Calir's people spread out around the hall, as well as the gently chuckling faces lining the mezzanine above. As he closed his pirouette of judgement more and more laughter broke out amongst the mercenaries watching the scene until, as Tharg faced Calir again, he was chuckling himself as well. The gentle laughter petered out. Tharg's expression soured as his amusement turned to contempt, which morphed into fury. He glared at Calir.</p>
<p>"Join us or be meat for our table!" he shrieked, "And you!" he pointed a blue finger at Calir, "You! We shall cast this one into the Dark Mirror so that he can forever ponder the fate of this friends!"</p>
<p>This last exclamation was met with rapturous laughter, approval and applause from the mezzanine. Two or three of Tharg's men tramped down the stairwell and surrounded a stunned Calir, lifting him bodily from his feet. They dragged him up the stairs and out of sight.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Suspended over the circular abyss, rimmed with irregular shaped blocks of stone, Calir felt a new level of terror. The men holding him on either side had ice-cold grasps and, this close, he could see frozen globules of saliva and blood in their beards. They smelled of death. The circular opening itself was a dark void out of which blew a continuous stream of cold air that seemed quite at odds with the immediate surroundings, which were still. As he gazed down into the pit, Calir tried and failed to see any features below. It was dark as night and hollow as his remaining hope.</p>
<p>Tharg stepped up to the edge and into Calir's line of sight. He leant over the edge theatrically and let out a low whistle.</p>
<p>"Its a long way down boys, a long, cold way down."</p>
<p>This was met with murmurs of agreement from all around. The hands closed around Calir's arms didn't slacken, but they jostled him slightly, mocking him. Tharg turned slightly to Calir, addressing him.</p>
<p>"The Dark Mirror, they say, lies at the bottom of this abyss. Its a legend, of course, because we know of none who can confirm it. But, if the legend is true then you will fall for an age before striking it. And, upon striking it, will come into contact with all of the sorcery and wonder of my Kingdom. The Dark Mirror makes everything about our place in the world possible and you, my gallant, fearless hero, have the privilege of meeting her face-to-face."</p>
<p>This last was greeted with another murmurs of amusement from the small crowd gathered around the hole. Tharg smiled, with less malevolence this time and just a touch of nostalgia.</p>
<p>"Give her our best..."</p>
<p>He nodded to the men holding Calir and, before he'd realised the intent of this gesture, Calir found himself being cast bodily into this abyss. As he fell, he let out a cry that was heard throughout the Palace of Tharg. It drew a smile on the faces of Tharg's band and a sick realisation of doom from the remainder of Calir's group. With Calir's death, they were absolutely destitute of hope or salvation and were abandoned to the evil clutches of Tharg and his mercenaries. They would never get home and would have to live forever in this desolate land of ice and misery. Every one of them wept, for themselves more than for Calir.</p>
