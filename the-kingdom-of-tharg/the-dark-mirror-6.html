<p>What came next was the strangest experience of Calir's life. He would have said that they worked for days - weeks, even - except that he had no concept of the passage of time. They did not stop for meals or sleep, but Calir didn't get hungry or thirsty or tired. It was as if their bodies were suspended in a moment in time and their minds were free to work and work and work. And what work it was. In his previous life, Calir would have baulked at what Aevum asked him to do. Now, though, he was just glad to be doing something to aid their escape and keep his mind off the other-worldly experience of their state of suspended time. Aevum had explained that the only way out of their chamber was to summon the Dark Mirror to pull them out and deposit them some where else. It was this, Aevum explained, that had brought Calir here in the first place. The rite they would need to perform Aevum had conducted before - just once - and it had brought him here as well. They would need to replicate Aevum's previous success if they had any hope of escaping. To Aevum this might have been just another dark ceremony, but to Calir it was also a lifeline. He was suppressing all thoughts of Dark Magic and summoning evil spirits. He just wanted to get home to Domum continent.</p>
<p>To begin with, they would need to perform a complicated dance around the centre of the room, sketching out the pictograms of the Dark Mirror in time and space, before placing themselves in the centre of the circle of power that they had drawn. Then, they would need to chant the summoning spell of the Dark Mirror, coercing her into their presence with lost words that only a Dark Mage would know (so Aevum said). Finally, when She was present they would need to shed the blood of the last person to pass through her gates. If she was satisfied with this sacrifice, she would pull the occupants of the circle into her darkness and expel them to a place and time of her choosing. This was the part that made Calir most nervous. He wanted to go home. Although Aevum wouldn't say where he wanted to go, he was helping Calir and that was something. But it was up to the Dark Mirror herself to choose where and when to deposit her summoners and, according to Aevum, she didn't take requests. Calir just had to hope that she would take them somewhere close to home. As for when, he couldn't wrap his mind around the idea of there being any-when else to be than here and now. He had asked Aevum about it, but all he had said was, "Time is in the Dark Mirror, and the Dark Mirror is in time," which, of course, Calir found to be completely confounding.</p>
<p>At last, after an immeasurable delay, Aevum was satisfied with Calir's recital of the ritual and allowed him to begin. They traced the filigree of steps, prances and hops necessary to draw the glyphs of the Dark Mirror's power. Then, with great ceremony, they stepped inside this invisible ring and began reciting the words that would bring Her in as well. Calir wasn't quite sure what to expect after this, but moments after they finished the final words of summoning, things began to change. He hadn't noticed it, but the entire time he'd been in the chamber the air had been still, the temperature cool and the illumination constant. Now though, with the last breath of sound leaving Calir's lips, a rush of air blew up from the floor dousing the room in an icy blast. This influx of cold air seemed to wash away the golden-yellow light, replacing it with a shadowy dusk that transformed the stones from sand to the granite of tombstones. With his eyes wide, Calir crouched and looked around wildly. Air was rushing up from beneath him, the light was flickering and being turned black like the tongues of a dark flame and the temperature was dropping rapidly. He looked over at Aevum for reassurance and found none in his stolid figure and hooded face. The mage simply stood there with his arms by his side, completely unaffected by the maelstrom of air and darkness that was rapidly surrounding them.</p>
<p>Calir was about to call out to Aevum to ask him whether this was expected or if they had done something wrong, when a different voice interjected. It was a voice of echoes and reverberations, rebounding out from time like a voice run backwards. It was as if you could hear it before it spoke and it spoke before you could hear it.</p>
<p>"Who summons me with audacity and arrogance? What are you to command my mighty power! Speak now or I shall tear you down to an even deeper hell!"</p>
<p>Somehow even after all of their practising and rehearsals, Calir wasn't quite sure who was supposed to answer her. His palms were sweating with fear about the upcoming sacrifice, even though all he had to do was draw a slither of blood across his hand in a ceremonial gesture. Still, was he supposed to step up now and offer her his blood? Before he could take the hesitant step he was preparing for, Aevum stepped forward himself, casting back his hood and spreading his arms wide.</p>
<p>"It is I, Aevum of the Midnight Dark, seer of the Crystal Night and Dark Mage of Power! Hear me, oh mighty reflective one, and accept this sacrifice for our passage to other places and times!"</p>
<p>As if this was a completely normal occurrence, Aevum then gestured to Calir to step forward. He did so and held out his damp palm towards Aevum. Raising his right arm, with a small dull blade clutched in his hand, Aevum continued.</p>
<p>"I shed the blood of a life not yet lived, of time not yet spent, of a journey not yet over. Take this blood and let it slake your thirst!"</p>
