<h2>The Call of the Mirror</h2>

                <hr>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>Their little vessel bumped up against the icy shore like a toy boat. The humidity rising from the water had Calor sweating, even in just his tunic and breeches, so the cool air wafting off the ice was a welcome relief. He inhaled.</p>
<p>"Ah, smell that cool, crisp air, my good man! Hate to say it, but I believe I missed the clarity of it. The...freshness. Something pure about it, wouldn't you say?"</p>
<p>"It is the air of the realm of the Dark Mirror and the smell of the Kingdom of Tharg. I am not as welcoming of it as you, friend Calor, and you would do well to remember the perils we are walking back into."</p>
<p>"Just trying to look on the bright side, my good fellow, just trying to keep the old spirits up. Danger and darkness it might hold, but, truth be told, I was starting to feel a bit smothered by the thick air back there. Its not quite what I remembered, I have to say. Must be a heavier climate...further South..."</p>
<p>Calor trailed off, looking slightly puzzled. He couldn't quite reconcile his feeling of relief at having gained landfall at the Ice Continent again. He ought be filled with dread. But, at most, all he felt was mild trepidation. Aevum stepped ashore, which knocked Calor out of his reverie. They scraped the small craft inland far enough that it was well away from the water's edge - just in case they needed to return this way - and then looked around to get their bearings. Off to their left, further away than when last they saw it, was the half-wreck of the leading galleon. The bow was still a rotting husk, more hole than plank, slowly collapsing into the virulent sea. The stern was still a frozen moment of majesty, speaking of pride and beauty and excellence, apart from its ragged sails and torn flags.</p>
<p>"Do you remember the way back, friend Calor?"</p>
<p>"I do, I do! Follow the ships until the ice rises up into the glaciers and then - trust to our instincts I suppose!"</p>
<p>"Indeed. I can probably help us there, friend Calor. You lead us to the ice and then we shall see if the Dark Mirror's ethereal sorcery leads us back to Tharg."</p>
<p>Calor paused for a moment to consider this. Then, deciding that he didn't understand it and didn't need to, he strode off towards the next ship, stuck in the ice on the horizon. Aevum watched the fellow walk away purposefully, filled with an energy that you might never have thought would animate him again, had you seen him two days earlier on this same stretch of frozen sea. A slight frown crossed the mage's face as his eyes flicked down to the bundle of material at this feet. Cloaks and shawls with a heavy belt and a pair of thick leather boots. All of these Calor had been wearing when Aevum had first encountered him in the sealed cell in the bowels of the Dark Mirror. All of them Calor had shed when they had returned to the warmer climes of Domum. And, all of them Calor had carried with him in their little dinghy, with the intention of donning them again when they reached the ice. But, now, he was striding away bare-footed and open-chested, wearing nothing but his cotton shirt and linen breeches. Just days before, he was grumbling perpetually about the cold and the wind. Now, he didn't seem to notice either. Aevum had a deep sense of foreboding about this. It was normal for a mage of his power to remain unaffected by the shifting temperatures of the material world about him. He had been as comfortable in the tropical heat of Domum as he was now in the plummeting cold of the ice. He wore is robes and cloaks either way, unperturbed. But Calor - he was a simple man of a simple people. His kind didn't walk about on the frozen sea of Gelida in nothing but their skin unless they were crazed beyond belief, or imbued with some dark sorcery. As eccentric as the fellow was, Aevum feared that it was the latter and that fear furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>"What devilry do we face now? The Dark Mirror follows us still..."</p>
<p>With this murmur, he hastened to follow in the jaunty footsteps of hope that Calor was laying down on the crisp surface of the frozen sea. Footsteps of hope that the mage could not repeat.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"Well, that was the last one!" announced Calor gaily, as they walked past the final galleon before the shore.</p>
<p>Ahead of them rose the ice sheets of Tharg's kingdom. Jagged blades of ice jutting out of the calm, glassy surface of the sea, rising to form the ice continent. It was like something from a nightmare, except Calor had forgotten and now found himself eager to return.</p>
<p>"I'm eager to find my friends", he told himself, "I want to see them safely back to Domum, safely back home." He repeated this to himself like a mantra, but the truth was that he was excited to return to Tharg's palace. He wouldn't admit it to himself, and he didn't know why, but part of him was excited to see it again. It held an allure in his mind that could not be explained, nor denied.</p>
<p>"I shall lead us from now, friend Calor."</p>
<p>Aevum stepped forwards, gazing towards the fractured landscape of ice rising before them.</p>
<p>"It will take all of our skill and more than a little luck to navigate the mysterious interior of this continent. But! Fear not! A dark mage of my power and experience is a match for this challenge. We shall prevail. I shall return you to your friends."</p>
<p>"I have every faith in you, my good man. You've not failed me yet and I don't expect you to now-"</p>
<p>"However, when re-united you are, then I must leave you."</p>
<p>"Leave me? But why my good man? Whatever would you do without me? We're comrades, fellow prisoners, fellow journeymen on a quest!"</p>
<p>Aevum nodded in agreement and allowed himself the smallest smile. Calor thought he looked sad.</p>
<p>"Indeed, friend Calor, indeed. But, when the time comes, you will understand."</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>And so began the second great part of their journey. Except this was longer and more arduous than the first. This time they were walking back into the interior of the ice continent, further than they had gone before and towards the source of dark magic that covered the land, not away from it. But, Calor found the trek easier, somehow. The mage had pointed out to him that he had forgotten his warm clothes and he had been surprised and amused to realise it.</p>
<p>"Oh! I suppose I have!" he chuckled, "Well, I must be getting a stronger constitution. All this cold air is good for a man, you know!"</p>
<p>He shrugged it off without a second thought, unlike Aevum who was deeply troubled by this change in his companion. As before, they needed little rest and rarely stopped for sleep. They ate nothing at all and, being full of bread at the beginning of their journey, suffered neither hunger nor thirst. Again, unlike their outward journey when this was a source of constant complaints from Calor, this time he didn't notice at all. It was Aevum, who was used to this kind of thing himself, who noticed the change in Calor.</p>
<p>"Where is his good natured appetite? His thirst for good ale? Where is his desire to be home besides a fireplace?"</p>
<p>These questions and more he asked himself as the journeyed further and further into the Ice Continent. They walked for days and days, slowly picking their way across the shattered ice and between the jagged glaciers. Often they would have to back-track for half a day or more, because they stumbled across a great crevasse that was impassable or a shear cliff of brilliant, blue ice that was impossible to climb. However, they did make progress towards their destination and little by little, though Calor couldn't have said by how much, they approached Tharg's palace.</p>
<p>The mage was guiding them by an inner sense of the source of the Dark Mirror's magic. Whenever he wasn't sure what direction they should take, he sat down in the snow and allowed himself to sink into a trance that had his mind ebbing and flowing with the currents of sorcery around him. After each of these trances, he had a strong sense of where the Dark Mirror's power was emanating from and could easily point them in the right direction. Without Aevum's powers, Calor would soon have been lost in the icy wilderness. But, as it was, he felt safe and confident in his friend's guidance and - missing neither sleep nor food nor ale - was happy to pass the days trekking in the mage's wake.</p>
<p>Through all of this toil and in the face of the icy blasts of air that pummelled them perpetually, the only change in himself that Calor was really aware of was his growing strength. Day by day, he seemed to find the walking easier. To begin with, when they needed to clamber up a rocky outcrop or climb down into a shallow crevasse, he did so with shaky knees and sweating palms, barely managing to keep himself from falling. But, the further into their journey they went the easier he found these sorts of things. Before long, he found he could easily jump down slopes he would have needed to carefully climb down before. He found himself vaulting up slopes that previously would have taken him half an hour or more to climb. And, whereas to begin with his legs would be tired at the end of the day and his feet sore (even if he wasn't particularly sleepy), now his muscles felt vigorous and strong and he felt that he could walk and walk and walk and never feel a thing. His leg and arms were strong, he was becoming broad-chested and his feet had become hard and muscular. He felt like a new man, and a better man at that.</p>
<p>He noticed all of this just below the level of his conscious thoughts. Whenever he did note this to himself, it was always something like, "I'm feeling good today, yes Calor, this wintry air is good for you!" or, "Nothing like a stretch of the legs to clear the cobwebs and get the old ticker going!".</p>
<p>All in all, by the time they reached Tharg's palace a great change had overtaken Calor and the only one of the two of them who had really noticed was Aevum.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"Is that it?"</p>
<p>"You tell me, friend Calor, you are the one who was held captive there."</p>
<p>They were peeking over a low ridge of ice at a sandstone fortress nestled amongst the glaciers. Its yellow stone looked almost warm surrounded as it was by the whites and blues of the landscape.</p>
<p>"Yes, but I didn't see it from this angle before. We went in through some kind of entrance tunnel, with a portcullis I seem to remember, but this is quite different."</p>
<p>From their vantage point, they were looking across and slightly down onto the fortress. It was surrounded by a high, smooth wall topped with ramparts which was roughly square, but easily two hundred meters along each side. Within the walls was a bulky, squat structure that had four square towers in each corner and a domed roof in the centre. It looked completely out of place, set as it was against a backdrop of eternal permafrost. It might have been more at home amongst the dunes of an Arabian city or desert oasis. Much like the galleon ships that they had followed across the frozen sea, it was if the ice had swept in around this palace, effacing all its surroundings but preserving the centrepiece as a warning to future generations.</p>
<p>"Whether this is the place where you and your friends stumbled across Tharg I cannot say. But, it is emanating waves of temporal power unlike anything I have felt elsewhere. There is no doubt that this is the home of the Dark Mirror."</p>
<p>"It must be the place then - the pit in Tharg's palace was directly over the Mirror. They cast me right into it!"</p>
<p>"Indeed. Well, friend Calor. What is your plan now?"</p>
<p>Calor looked puzzled for a moment and then considered this question. Aevum felt a touch of sympathy for the fellow. He had clearly been so focused on getting here that he hadn't given much thought to what they would do when they arrived.</p>
<p>"Well, come to think of it, I've been so focused on our journey that - it's strange isn't it? - I haven't given any thought to what we might do when we got here!"</p>
<p>Aevum smiled to himself.</p>
<p>"But, I suppose the original plan still holds. Here we are, armed with the curse of the Dark Mirror, able to move for minutes in an instant of their time. We can saunter in, take the measure of the place, find my friends and then carry them out one by one - all before Tharg or his cronies have even noticed that we've arrived! What say you, my good man?"</p>
<p>"Your plan is indeed a good one, friend Calor. Let us hope it is as easy as you say."</p>
<p>With this, Calor nodded once and crested the ridge the had been crouched behind. He led the way down to the small clearing dominated by the fortress and soon gained the wall.</p>
<p>"Let's walk around it until we find the entrance I remember."</p>
<p>Aevum inclined his head and followed the man in a careful circumnavigation of the palace. They'd made it around three of the four walls, when they came to a broad avenue carved out of the ice. It led from the wilderness of the ice sheet straight to the wall and under a broad archway. The teeth of a portcullis were visible poking out from beneath the rim of the arch and light was visible beyond the tunnel's span.</p>
<p>"Ah ha! This must be it...yes, I'm sure of it. Well, come on then my good man, fortune favours the bold!"</p>
<p>Jogging off into the tunnel, he left Aevum in his wake to follow in a more dignified manner. Aevum wasn't sure what to expect from the interior, but he was certain it would not be what Calor was expecting. The magic of the Dark Mirror did not work in ways that could easily be understood by mortals, and Calor's measure of their situation simply felt too good to be true. The mage was on his guard.</p>
<p>When Aevum caught up with Calor in a large chamber into which the entrance tunnel emerged, he found the man looking around slightly lost.</p>
<p>"I was expecting to find them here - this is where I left them!"</p>
<p>"That was several weeks ago, for us my friend. Even for them that must have been several hours - days even. Courage, friend Calor, it is with evil sorcery that now we contend."</p>
<p>Calor nodded his head knowingly and looked around once more. They were in wide, tall, square chamber. There was a wall of sorts half way across, which reached about a third of the way to the ceiling. There was a stone balustrade across its rim and a small doorway half way along its base.</p>
<p>"Ah! That's where Tharg came from, its where they took me!" he called over his shoulder with excitement, as he started walking towards it.</p>
<p>Reaching the doorway, which was open and without obstruction, he saw a line of steps leading up - he remembered being carried up these, his feet banging against each step as his tormentors dragged him up. Throwing caution to the wind, he jumped up these two at a time, with the mage barely keeping up behind him. He gained the mezzanine level and glanced around. A few meters behind him was the balustrade with a view opening out onto the rest of the chamber. Ahead of him was a broad square that had the feel of a courtyard to it, except that it was covered by the vaulted ceiling and devoid of any plant life. Down each side ran a set of cloisters and on the back wall was a large, ornate doorframe, easily three or four metres high. From this distance, he couldn't make out much of the detail, but it seemed to be covered in carvings or statues. It was hung with a pair of giant oaken doors, gilt with iron fastenings. And, between him and this doorway there was a spot where the air seemed to shimmer and the floor was different. He paused and listened. Apart from the sound of Aevum patting up the steps behind him, there was silence. No voices, no raucous laughter, no screams of torture. Still, he thought, that must make sense. For the inhabitants of Tharg's palace, it would take a day to utter a single syllable. Of course he couldn't hear anything, he reassured himself.</p>
<p>"Well?", the mage had joined him.</p>
<p>"Nothing yet, lets investigate that," and he nodded towards the shimmering air between them and the back wall.</p>
<p>Aevum frowned but said nothing, following Calor at a distance towards the strange disturbance ahead of them.</p>
<p>When Aevum caught up with him, Calor was standing at the rim of a broad, circular opening in the floor. No light could be seen within and the sandstone walls lining the hole quickly disappeared into darkness. The faint sound of rushing air could be heard and, standing at the boundary, ice-cold air could be felt flowing out. Aevum joined Calor at the boundary and looked in.</p>
<p>"The Dark Mirror," stated Calor flatly.</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"Where is everyone? I was expecting them to be here, having a raucous feast, torturing my friends or...or...I don't know, doing something! But this place is empty, its like a ghost town, its like we're the first people to have been here in centuries."</p>
<p>The air continued to rush out of the opening with a faint hiss. For a moment, Calor thought he could here the whispering of a woman's voice beneath the rushing, but then it passed and he just gazed into the darkness beneath them.</p>
<p>"The Dark Mirror is the centre of an ancient, malevolent and cruel power, friend Calor. With Her, nothing is ever as it seems and is often a good deal worse than one might expect. But, hope is the bane of her power. You never know, your friends with Tharg and his gang might be just through that door," he motioned to the ornate doorway ahead of them, "or they may have freed themselves and at this very moment might be journeying home by the same path that brought you here. Anything is possible with this degree of sorcery in the air - anything and everything. Whilst the Dark Mirror's power is potent, it is not invincible. In the crack's between her spells hope breeds, and it is this hope that you must harbour, now that I am to leave you."</p>
<p>"Leave me! Why, not yet my friend! Let us find my friends first, then you may go your own way, but- well, I shall be lost without you! Why ever must you go now?"</p>
<p>"It is not I who choose, but She. She is calling to me, have you not heard, she will not let me leave her, not yet, she summons me back."</p>
<p>"Good lord, what is this devilry!"</p>
<p>"It is my curse, my friend - and my friend you are. I am sorry I have not been able to help you, but I will try - I will continue to try."</p>
<p>"But of course you've helped me, I wouldn't have made it this far without you. But I don't understand, my good man, can you not escape her clutches?"</p>
<p>Aevum smiled at this. A slow, sad smile and then closed his eyes. The out-rushing of air paused for a moment and then, with the slightest inward breeze, the mage fell forward and tumbled into the pit. He uttered neither cry nor scream, but fell in silence into the darkness and cold of the Dark Mirror. He fell and fell and Calor saw him no more.</p>
