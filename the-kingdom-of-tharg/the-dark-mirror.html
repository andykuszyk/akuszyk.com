            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>Calor's screams eventually gave out. When they did, he found himself relaxing slightly. He was falling and falling and falling, but he couldn't feel it any more. The sick lurch of his stomach, the thrill of his heart and the feeling of impending death had left him, replaced with numb realisation that he was falling from life. All he could feel now was the frigid rush of air past his face and the slow tumble of his body. He could see nothing, neither wall nor sky nor floor. Blind and frozen, he was falling into the bowels of this mysterious ice continent towards who knew what. Tharg's last cryptic words about the magic of this Dark Mirror were completely lost on Calor, whose simple mind could only think of the warm, golden fields of wheat and the merry ale houses of home. He was stunned into silence and remission by the endless wail of frozen air numbing his face and his body, his mind and his soul. He was lost in an endless fall from life to death, from light to dark and from the time of friendship and love to a time of loneliness and eternal isolation. He was lost.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of falling, during which Calor found himself waking with a start more than once, a sensation in his gut told him that he was slowing. Against all expectations, he was being brought to rest rather than falling to his demise. Quicker and quicker now he could feel his descent being retarded. Up ahead of him - or, rather, down below him - a faint postage stamp of dim light could be made out. Calor wasn't quite sure what he could see, but it looked like a dim circle of midnight blue growing as he fell. Soon it was the size of his palm, then two palms. Before long, he could see the disc widening, except now it wasn't widening - he was falling slowly towards it and it was getting closer.</p>
<p>He could make it out now. It was a disc of subtle, midnight blue. The light was rising from the disc like mist from a cold, dawn lake. It shimmered and shifted like a mystic ether evapourating into the darkness. From the looks of things, it was about ten metres across and was slightly concave - a shallow bowl of light. As far as he could tell, Calor was hovering about three or four metres above the disc's surface, gently descending now. He figured he'd probably land on it in the next few minutes.</p>
<p>"So, you must be the Dark Mirror that the mighty King Tharg was so afraid of, I suppose?", he murmured to the darkness.</p>
<p>The Mirror returned no answer and remained enigmatic in its silence. Calor was now a metre above it. He could almost feel the ethereal light brushing past his skin.</p>
<p>"What happens when I touch you?"</p>
<p>Calor was whispering now. The Mirror was impassive.</p>
<p>Centimetres to go now. If he'd been able, Calor would have reached forward and touched the surface of the Mirror, but some invisible force was holding him prone. He closed his eyes and held his breath. Any moment now.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Calor awoke with a start. He was laying face down on a cold, hard surface. It was slightly gritty and, as he raised his head, he could feel particles of dirt and sand sticking to his skin. He'd been laying there for a while. His entire body was cold from lying against the stone for so long - he groaned as he slowly picked himself up into a kneeling position. Looking around, he found himself in a circular room built of the same sandy stone as the Tharg's palace. Big blocks lined the walls and the floor was covered in flagstones of the same material. The walls gently arched upwards to form a domed ceiling. There were no doors. No windows. The room was sealed and Calor could see no way in through which he had arrived and no way out through which he could escape. He was in a cocooned prison cell. It took a few moments for Calor to realise that there was no light either - there was no source of light, yet the entire room seemed to be bathed in the golden, homely light of the stone below and the palace above.</p>
<p>A shuffling noise from behind him made him realise that he wasn't alone in his cell. He looked around sharply and noticed for the first time a small man seated on the floor, leaning against the wall. If Calor had seen him during his survey of the room, he could have been forgiven for taking him as a small bundle of rags. He was dressed in a loose robe of dirty brown fabric, with its hood over his face and his legs and arms tucked into its folds. The robe looked far too big for him, but perhaps his incarceration had shrunk his body within the confines of the garb. All of these thoughts flashed through Calor's mind in an instant as he reflected that this forlorn figure would be Calor's fate if he couldn't find a way out of this room.</p>
<p>"Er, hello there, my good man...found yourself a prisoner her as well, hey?"</p>
<p>Calor tried to sound friendly, but his words sounded hollow and muffled in the enclosed space of the small chamber. The man looked up at Calor's words, making his face visible from beneath the hood. He had a dark complexion, with long black hair framing a sunken, sallow face. He responded to Calor's question with muted silence and an impassive stare.</p>
<p>"Yes, well, I've just arrived. Although, I suppose you know that. Probably saw me fall through the roof, or however I got here. Strange isn't it? That there's no doors? No entrance or exit? Come to think of it - how do we eat? What do we drink? Its like we're sealed in some kind of morbid burial chamber. Where are we even?"</p>
<p>Before he knew it, this torrent of questions had tumbled out of him like a river bursting its banks. He paused to consider the questions he'd asked. But, before he'd had a chance, the man offered some answers of his own.</p>
<p>"This," he began, his voice low and hoarse, "is the Dark Mirror. The centre of its evil magic. The source of Tharg's great power. A burial chamber?"</p>
<p>He laughed a cracked and crooked laugh to himself.</p>
<p>"No, it is the bringer of life to those who are cast here. It is the outside world that is buried, not us. We are set free in this place!"</p>
<p>Calor glanced about himself. He certainly didn't feel set free. In fact, if anything, the walls seemed to be closing in the longer he was present in this chamber of death and life.</p>
<p>"I don't really understand what you're saying, my friend, but tell me this: how long have you been here? Is there a way out?"</p>
<p>"How long? How long. Time does not matter here, newcomer, it is not a thing to be measured with words like â€˜long'. Time is in the Dark Mirror, and the Dark Mirror is in time. As for a way out? Yes, yes, there is a way out. Impossible for one, but with two? Perhaps."</p>
<p>"My goodness! Do you mean to say that you've been trapped here for who knows how long, tormented by the knowledge of a way to escape, but lacking only a fellow prisoner to execute your plan?"</p>
<p>"It is no hardship on my part, newcomer. I came here to wait, if waiting you can call it. I have been expecting you and I came her in expectation of you. Welcome, be welcome."</p>
<p>These last words sent a fresh shiver down Calor's spine. This odd little man had been expecting him? Had Tharg known of their arrival in advance? Had he warned him? Was this prisoner responsible for their straying into the Ice Kingdom? It was enough to make poor Calor's head spin. He shook his head and promptly sat down in the middle of the room, where he'd found himself sprawled out a few minutes earlier, and faced the bundle of clothes expounding upon his predicament so confoundingly.</p>
<p>"Calor. My name is Calor, my good man. And yours is?"</p>
<p>"Aevum."</p>
<p>"Well, er, nice to meet you my good, er, Aevum. May we forever be friends and never be enemies."</p>
<p>Aevum stared back in silence.</p>
<p>"That's what we say where I come from, when we meet someone new. It means, let's start off by being friends and thinking the best of one another and try to get along. A wise idea for the two of us, eh?"</p>
<p>He chuckled as he spoke, trying to illicit the same from the stoney face of Aevum.</p>
<p>"I am Aevum, a Dark Mage and seer of the Crystal Night. I would make a poor friend and a worse enemy. May we know one another and remain true to ourselves. That is the best I can offer you."</p>
<p>"Very well," replied Calor in friendly tone, "may we know one another and find friendship if we can."</p>
<p>The mage nodded once in assent, which Calor took as a small victory. He smiled and Aevum, for his part, didn't grimace.</p>
<p>"Now, what's all this business about you expecting me? How could you have been expecting me when there is no way in and, as far as I can see, no way out of this place? Answer me that, friend Aevum."</p>
<p>"You think of expectation as being the cause before the effect. In this place, where there is no time, sometimes the effect comes before the cause. If you like, your arrival led to my expectation of you and decision to seek you out in advance. The arrow of time can point any way in this place. Forward or backward - it makes no difference here."</p>
<p>This left Calor feeling even more confused, sat on the floor, and he held his head in his hands.</p>
<p>"A way out, you said we could escape together. Just tell me about that!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. There is a way, but you will need to learn first."</p>
<p>"Learn?"</p>
<p>"Mmm, learn of the dark magic that binds this place, learn some of the dark lore that I possess. Only with this knowledge will you be able to assist me in making a portal."</p>
<p>"A portal where? Can we go back to Domum?"</p>
<p>"Domum? I am unfamiliar with that place."</p>
<p>"Well! Not heard of Domum? What kind of mage do you call yourself?"</p>
<p>"A Dark one, friend."</p>
<p>Calor paused briefly, evaluating the ominous expression on the mage's face, before carrying on lightly.</p>
<p>"Domum is my home continent, filled with small townships, green pastures and gentle rivers. Its warm in the Summers, mild in the Winters and a joy in the Spring! I've lived there all my life, apart from these short forays into the mountains - none of which have gone awry until now I should say - and would dearly love to get back there. No more of this ice and cold, Dark Magic and cocooned prison cells. Just warm evenings, good mead and hearty suppers. You'll like it there Aevum, it will put some colour on your cheeks and some meat on your bones! You'll be a different man there, I promise - it makes the best of everyone! Not like this place. This place seems to bring out the worst, especially of that bully Tharg and his cronies."</p>
<p>A shiver ran down Calor's spine as he recalled the recent past and his current predicament. He had almost forgotten himself in his recollections of home. But, all of a sudden, he found himself cold and shivering against the stone-cold floor. He got up stiffly and stamped his feet, rubbing his arms.</p>
<p>"Anywhere my good man, let's just get this over with and get anywhere but here. Then, I'm sure we can find our way back home. My sense of direction (never failed me before now), and your resourcefulness. We'll be back to Domum continent in a jiffy. Let's just escape from this awful place and put as much distance between us and Tharg as possible!"</p>
<p>A silence spread out from these words as Calor slowly stopped fidgeting and Aevum gazed at him impassively. Calor was beginning to think he might have said the wrong thing and that perhaps this mage had been friends with Tharg, or that he liked the Ice continent, when Aevum finally stirred.</p>
<p>"Yes. Let us begin."</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>What came next was the strangest experience of Calor's life. He would have said that they worked for days - weeks, even - except that he had no concept of the passage of time. They did not stop for meals or sleep, but Calor didn't get hungry or thirsty or tired. It was as if their bodies were suspended in a moment in time and their minds were free to work and work and work. And what work it was. In his previous life, Calor would have baulked at what Aevum asked him to do. Now, though, he was just glad to be doing something to aid their escape and keep his mind off the other-worldly experience of their state of suspended time. Aevum had explained that the only way out of their chamber was to summon the Dark Mirror to pull them out and deposit them some where else. It was this, Aevum explained, that had brought Calor here in the first place. The rite they would need to perform Aevum had conducted before - just once - and it had brought him here as well. They would need to replicate Aevum's previous success if they had any hope of escaping. To Aevum this might have been just another dark ceremony, but to Calor it was also a lifeline. He was suppressing all thoughts of Dark Magic and summoning evil spirits. He just wanted to get home to Domum continent.</p>
<p>To begin with, they would need to perform a complicated dance around the centre of the room, sketching out the pictograms of the Dark Mirror in time and space, before placing themselves in the centre of the circle of power that they had drawn. Then, they would need to chant the summoning spell of the Dark Mirror, coercing her into their presence with lost words that only a Dark Mage would know (so Aevum said). Finally, when She was present they would need to shed the blood of the last person to pass though her gates. If she was satisfied with this sacrifice, she would pull the occupants of the circle into her darkness and expel them to a place and time of her choosing. This was the part that made Calor most nervous. He wanted to go home. Although Aevum wouldn't say where he wanted to go, he was helping Calor and that was something. But it was up to the Dark Mirror herself to choose where and when to deposit her summoners and, according to Aevum, she didn't take requests. Calor just had to hope that she would take them somewhere close to home. As for when, he couldn't wrap his mind around the idea of there being any-when else to be than here and now. He had asked Aevum about it, but all he had said was, "Time is in the Dark Mirror, and the Dark Mirror is in time," which, of course, Calor found to be completely confounding.</p>
<p>At last, after an immeasurable delay, Aevum was satisfied with Calor's recital of the ritual and allowed him to begin. They traced the filigree of steps, prances and hops necessary to draw the glyphs of the Dark Mirror's power. Then, with great ceremony, they stepped inside this invisible ring and began reciting the words that would bring Her in as well. Calor wasn't quite sure what to expect after this, but moments after they finished the final words of summoning, things began to change. He hadn't noticed it, but the entire time he'd been in the chamber the air had been still, the temperature cool and the illumination constant. Now though, with the last breath of sound leaving Calor's lips, a rush of air blew up from the floor dousing the room in an icy blast. This influx of cold air seemed to wash away the golden-yellow light, replacing it with a shadowy dusk that transformed the stones from sand to the granite of tombstones. With his eyes wide, Calor crouched and looked around wildly. Air was rushing up from beneath him, the light was flickering and being turned black like the tongues of a dark flame and the temperature was dropping rapidly. He looked over at Aevum for reassurance and found none in his stolid figure and hooded face. The mage simply stood there with his arms by his side, completely unaffected by the maelstrom of air and darkness that was rapidly surrounding them.</p>
<p>Calor was about to call out to Aevum to ask him whether this was expected or if they had done something wrong, when a different voice interjected. It was a voice of echoes and reverberations, rebounding out from time like a voice run backwards. It was as if you could hear it before it spoke and it spoke before you could hear it.</p>
<p>"Who summons me with audacity and arrogance? What are you to command my mighty power! Speak now or I shall tear you down to an even deeper hell!"</p>
<p>Somehow even after all of their practising and rehearsals, Calor wasn't quite sure who was supposed to answer her. His palms were sweating with fear about the upcoming sacrifice, even though all he had to do was draw a slither of blood across his hand in a ceremonial gesture. Still, was he supposed to step up now and offer her his blood? Before he could take the hesitant step he was preparing for, Aevum stepped forward himself, casting back his hood and spreading his arms wide.</p>
<p>"It is I, Aevum of the Midnight Dark, seer of the Crystal Night and Dark Mage of Power! Hear me, oh mighty reflective one, and accept this sacrifice for our passage to other places and times!"</p>
<p>As if this was a completely normal occurrence, Aevum then gestured to Calor to step forward. He did so and held out his damp palm towards Aevum. Raising his right arm, with a small dull blade clutched in his hand, Aevum continued.</p>
<p>"I shed the blood of a life not yet lived, of time not yet spent, of a journey not yet over. Take this blood and let it slake your thirst!"</p>
<p>With this, he quickly brought the knife to bear against Calor's slippery palm and, making Calor jump with its suddenness, drew it across leaving a line of dark red behind. Aevum mimed clenching his fist and waving it over the ground. As soon as Calor realised what he meant, he copied the gesture until a few drops of his blood dripped from his hand to land in a scatter-gun pattern on the floor. Almost immediately the howling air slackened, the temperature rose slightly and a somewhat more relaxed voice filled the air.</p>
<p>"Mmmm, I accept the sacrifice. When would you bid me take you?"</p>
<p>Aevum looked across at Calor and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Home! Back home please your, er, shininess," Aevum shot Calor a questioning look, who shrugged helplessly. "Domum Continent please, or thereabouts."</p>
<p>The air continued to calm, the temperature continued to rise, and the voice became almost maternal.</p>
<p>"Indeed, but when child?"</p>
<p>This time, it was Calor's turn to looking questioningly at Aevum. He still didn't really understand all this timelessness.</p>
<p>"Before my friends and I were captured I suppose, before we were caught by Tharg!"</p>
<p>"Indeed..."</p>
<p>The breeze slowed to a stop and the temperature returned to normal. The room was suddenly calm and still, with only the gentle glow of the walls remaining steady. Except that it wasn't remaining steady, it was diminishing almost imperceptibly. Dimmer and dimmer, as if it was lulling them off to sleep. Come to think of it, Calor did feel tired - for the first time since he could remember. His eyes were heavy and his limbs leaden. He'd just have a lay down on the floor, which didn't seem all that cold any more. It was getting dark now. He'd just have a nap and then they'd be on their way. These were his last thoughts within the Dark Mirror.</p>
