                <p>Through all of this toil and in the face of the icy blasts of air that pummelled them perpetually, the only change in himself that Calir was really aware of was his growing strength. Day by day, he seemed to find the walking easier. To begin with, when they needed to clamber up a rocky outcrop or climb down into a shallow crevasse, he did so with shaky knees and sweating palms, barely managing to keep himself from falling. But, the further into their journey they went the easier he found these sorts of things. Before long, he found he could easily jump down slopes he would have needed to carefully climb down before. He found himself vaulting up slopes that previously would have taken him half an hour or more to climb. And, whereas to begin with his legs would be tired at the end of the day and his feet sore (even if he wasn't particularly sleepy), now his muscles felt vigorous and strong and he felt that he could walk and walk and walk and never feel a thing. His leg and arms were strong, he was becoming broad-chested and his feet had become hard and muscular. He felt like a new man, and a better man at that.</p>
<p>He noticed all of this just below the level of his conscious thoughts. Whenever he did note this to himself, it was always something like, "I'm feeling good today, yes Calir, this wintry air is good for you!" or, "Nothing like a stretch of the legs to clear the cobwebs and get the old ticker going!".</p>
<p>All in all, by the time they reached Tharg's palace a great change had overtaken Calir and the only one of the two of them who had really noticed was Aevum.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"Is that it?"</p>
<p>"You tell me, friend Calir, you are the one who was held captive there."</p>
<p>They were peeking over a low ridge of ice at a sandstone fortress nestled amongst the glaciers. Its yellow stone looked almost warm surrounded as it was by the whites and blues of the landscape.</p>
<p>"Yes, but I didn't see it from this angle before. We went in through some kind of entrance tunnel, with a portcullis I seem to remember, but this is quite different."</p>
<p>From their vantage point, they were looking across and slightly down onto the fortress. It was surrounded by a high, smooth wall topped with ramparts which was roughly square, but easily two hundred yards along each side. Within the walls was a bulky, squat structure that had four square towers in each corner and a domed roof in the centre. It looked completely out of place, set as it was against a backdrop of eternal permafrost. It might have been more at home amongst the dunes of an desert city. Much like the galleon ships that they had followed across the frozen sea, it was if the ice had swept in around this palace, effacing all its surroundings but preserving the centrepiece as a warning to future generations.</p>
<p>"Whether this is the place where you and your brother stumbled across Tharg I cannot say. But, it is emanating waves of temporal power unlike anything I have felt elsewhere. There is no doubt that this is the home of the Dark Mirror."</p>
