                <p>Silence prevailed as they padded across the frozen water. Occasionally a vibrating tremor would run through surface, from the depths of the ice. Some shifting or changing that would propagate out to their feet like a leviathan of the deep reaching out for an instant. Silence prevailed between them as well. They walked on in silence. They had passed twenty or thirty great galleon ships now, Calir had lost count, yet still the ice stretched on ahead of them. Calir was certain he could see a lightening on the horizon now. It was if the dark ceiling of cloud above them stretched out to a particular point and then dispersed, revealing sunshine and warmth beyond. That's the way he imagined it anyway, with the ice ending at the same point, giving way to a gentle sea, lapping against the ice gaily with a pleasant warmth that welcomed the weary traveller. Calir was hungry, as usual, but now he was beginning to feel tired as well. Unlike previous days, he felt that he needed food to give him strength to carry on marching, not just to satisfy his unwavering hunger. Not only that, but he was thirsty too, and felt a renewed need for rest. He was terrified by the idea of climbing up into one of these ships for shelter and rest, but at the same time he didn't think he could make it all the way out to the horizon without respite. After several hours of brooding on these thoughts, he decided to broach the topic to Aevum.</p>
<p>"Well, my good fellow. I don't know about you, but I'm just about ready for some supper and shut-eye. What say you, eh?"</p>
<p>He tried to make this remark sound as jovial as possible, but the energy in his voice was muffled by the silent ice and ominous hull looming ahead of them. The ship they were drawing close to was stuck in the ice at an angle close to thirty degrees as if it had been swaying in the swell of the sea at the moment it was captured by the mirror-flat surface of the ice. Lines of rigging dangled over the sides in loose strands here and there that were frozen in a swish of wind that was forever immortalised by the freeze. Contrary to the timeless moment the ship was caught in, there was a tattered black and red flag hanging from the jaunty mast, flapping limply in the still air. To all appearances, it looked like a long-dead wreck imprisoned by the ice and mercilessly held captive across the centuries.</p>
<p>"That looks like a homely spot if ever I saw one!"</p>
<p>Calir gestured towards the wreck optimistically, looking at Aevum for affirmation.</p>
<p>"Indeed, it is drawing close to that time. We're close the edge of the ice shelf now, nearly at the boundary of the Dark Mirror's influence, but we will need to rest before we reach it. This one will do as well as any other."</p>
<p>They shuffled over to the ship across the ice, slipping here and there as it started to take on a wet sheen that foreshadowed the impending end of the ice sheet. The near-side of the ship was it's port side and it was pitched over such that they could see the far side of the deck above them. Close to, the balustrade around the edge of the deck was only a yard or so above their heads and was an easy climb up the trailing ropes hanging over the edge of the ship here and there. Despite the braids of the ropes being frozen, they managed to clamber aboard and were soon looking up at the width of the deck sloping up in front of them. On either side of them, the forecastle and poop were at a jaunty angle that served as a constant reminder that the ship appeared to have been frozen part way through being swept to one side by the swells of the water. They walked awkwardly towards the poop, where they both agreed a door would probably lead to the captain's cabin. Scattered along their path were the flotsam and jetsam of a working ship–crates and frozen spools of rope, barrels and rags of sails. They had clearly been flung about violently in some prior storm or battle, but now were all laid to rest against the balustrade that teetered out over the frozen sea.</p>
<p>"I hope there's a good meal to be had in their somewhere," Calir said under his breath, indicating the captain's cabin. "I heard that there was always a good stash of salted fish, or rum-soaked biscuits or other such sea-faring food, hidden away in the captain's trunk for when times ran hard on board ship. Hopefully the cold weather will have helped preserve it and there'll be enough for a snack. A snack and a snooze, that's all I need and then I'll be ready for one final push."</p>
<p>Calir paused, waiting for Aevum to agree–or disagree–but the mage was impassively silent.</p>
<p>"What say you, eh? My good man?", he prompted, still in a whisper.</p>
