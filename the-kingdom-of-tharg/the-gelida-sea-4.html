                <p>The two men looked around thoughtfully, not daring to venture any further into the room. A minute or more might have elapsed, before they both exclaimed in unison.</p>
<p>"I say!"</p>
<p>"What the devil!"</p>
<p>"You see it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's getting thicker...something's...forming..."</p>
<p>As they watched, the dust around the chairs and table seemed to be wafting across the floor and sliding up the chair legs. It was gathering on the seats of the chairs and clumping into piles here and there. The same thing was happening on the table top, as the grey powder swirled in drifts from place to place, concentrating into thicker patches on the plates and bowls. The dust on the chairs was now a solid mass growing upwards into a conical pile. Moments later it was changing colour from grey to greens, browns and reds.</p>
<p>"Phwoah, do you smell that?"</p>
<p>The mixture on the chairs was turning slimy and slick now, oozing over the edge of the seat and dripping down the legs. The smell was offensive. The reds looked awfully like decaying blood and the greens had the odour of rotting flesh.</p>
<p>"What's happening?" Calir exclaimed in a choked voice. Aevum watched impassively, a frown crossing his face.</p>
<p>As they watched in horror, the flesh and liquids began re-assembling themselves into bone and muscle, skin and hair. A rotting form of a corpse took shape before their eyes, the ageing process reversed. Time running backwards. Before long, the corpses had turned to peaceful figures sitting calmly at the moments of their death. The food on the table had passed through rotting and mouldy phases to appear again fresh and appealing. For a moment, the scene was peaceful and calm and, bizarrely, the most normal sight Calir had witnessed in what felt like years. Three men sat around a dinner table enjoying an array of foods and drinks. This moment perched on the edge of a temporal fulcrum before plunging back into the destructive rampage of age and decay. The eyeballs turned black and sunk into the skulls, the food was engulfed by grey-green fur and collapsed in on itself, the skin sank between the ribs exposing bloody bone and shredding meat. The figures crumpled into a ruin of maimed flesh and weeping fluid. The foods were just pools of mottled liquid. The wetness dried, the colours dimmed and seeming moments after it had all begun again, the table and chairs were once again covered in thick piles of grey dust. Time had erased the lives of men and meal alike, leaving nothing but ash.</p>
