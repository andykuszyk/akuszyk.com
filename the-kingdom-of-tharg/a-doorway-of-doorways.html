<h2>A Doorway of Doorways</h2>

                <hr>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>Silence prevailed. The eternal exhale from the void of The Mirror seemed to hold its breath. Calor let out a singular sob. Without Aevum he was utterly alone, friendless and hopelessly lost. What could he possibly accomplish without the Mage's guidance? It was Aevum who had led them here. Aevum who had worked out what was happening to them. Aevum who had guided them safely across the Gelida sea. Aevum who had rescued them from the catacombs of the Dark Mirror. Without Aevum, Calor realised, he would still be a prisoner in that cell without windows or doors. He would still be buried alive. He sniffed and wiped his eyes.</p>
<p>"Don't lose yourself yet, my good man, don't lose yourself just yet. There are still folks who need you - your friends are still out there."</p>
<p>He stared into the opening with a drawn look of despair on his face, before catching himself and forcing a wry smile onto his lips.</p>
<p>"And don't forget the last words of the Mage - hope! Its hope that's the bane of Her magic, so hope we must have!"</p>
<p>His words echoed hollowly in the wide, open hall and he shivered. His skin was still warm, despite the rags he was wearing, but he felt chilled to the bone.</p>
<p>"Come on, my man, what's through there? Got to keep going!"</p>
<p>He was pointing towards the large archway ahead that he had spotted when he'd first looked past the shimmering haze of the mirror. More out of the need to do something than to follow any vestige of curiosity, he moved around the circumference of the Mirror and made his way across the hall to far wall. The closer he got to the archway - which was easily three or four metres high and two across - the more he noticed how ornate it was. The hall itself was built out of simple, flat blocks of stone with no adornment or pattern. But the doorway was intricately decorated and was covered in small sculptures and carvings. They depicted all sorts of scenes - a farmer ploughing a field, a warrior slaying his adversary, a water god rising out of the waves. Next to the bare, plain walls of the hall around it, the doorway was a cacophony of imagery. The doors were the same, now he had gotten closer. They were crafted from giant oaken beams bolted together with thick plates of iron, but they had been carved and sculpted until you could hardly see the grain of the wood at all. Even the iron had patterns and pictures engraved in it, so that you couldn't look at a single point on the whole door or frame without seeing some kind of scene depicted.</p>
<p>When he was standing in front of the doors, he saw that they were very closely fitted into the frame and were shut tight. From looking at them, he would have thought they were locked fast and that there was no way through, but he tried them anyway. To his surprise, with each palm on either door, they gave easily and swung silently and smoothly inwards. They were perfectly balanced such that the lightest touch moved them ever-so-slightly inwards. He leant forwards slightly and they opened enough for him to walk through onto the threshold.</p>
<p>On the other side of the doors was another room that, whilst still large, was much smaller than the hall he had come from. Unlike the hall, it wasn't illuminated by shining yellow stone and large, open window frames, but was dull and dark. Not dark like a dungeon, but dark like a bedroom at night with a single candle burning. Except, instead of the warm orange glow of a candle, there was a pale shimmer of blue. The blue had an ethereal quality to it that didn't make Calor think of the ice outside, but instead had him imagining that the light was somehow filtering down from the surface of a shallow, warm sea and into the room. Unlike the boundary of the Mirror, where he felt a deep sense of unease and dread, here he felt oddly calm and at home. So, without a hint of the fear he had felt not five minutes previously, he stepped forward and through the doorway.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Inside, the room was wide and low. The stone of the walls was darker than the sandstone without and was marbled with veins of black and grey. The floor was paved with ill-fitting slabs, which sloped this way and that in an uneven surface that was a stark contrast to the smooth, yellow floor of outside. The stones themselves were dark and smooth, pitted and rounded as if they had been trodden by crowds for centuries. Calor didn't need to be an archaeologist to see that this room was much older than the rest of the fortress. This was its inner sanctum and it was almost as if the palace outside had been built around this room as a temple around a shrine.</p>
<p>Now that he was inside, he could clearly see where the other-worldly light was coming from. Arranged along the wall he had just stepped through, facing back towards the hall he had come from, were a set of eight doorways. There were four on either side of the intricate entrance through which he had come, although each was much smaller - barely large enough for a man to walk though. Each was built out of simple, black stone, with blockey frames that spoke of an ancient construction. However, the most interesting thing about the doorways was the doors themselves. Rather than housing aged wooden beams like the entrance to the room, each door was suffused with a blue glow that emanated from its edges and spread out into the room. In the centre of the doorways, the blue glow gave way to a slightly transparent scene that was different from door to door. Calor approached the first of the doors, on his right, and squinted into the light that was at once bright in the dullness of the room and hard to see at the same time. In the centre of the door, he could just make out what looked like a meadow. He looked closer and saw that the field of wild flowers seemed to be swaying gently in a breeze that he could not feel.</p>
<p>"Incredible!"</p>
<p>He reached out towards the doorway but, before touching it, checked himself and moved on to the next door. This next one was a stark mountainside - rocky with patches of snow and ice and not a hint of vegetation in sight. The next was a bustling town square with people coming and going, seemingly oblivious to his vantage point from the doorway. And so it went on. Each of the doors depicted a different scene except that, unlike the images carved into the entrance to this room, each of the scenes was alive and in motion and - from what he could make out from beneath the glowing light - looked perfectly real.</p>
<p>On the back wall, immediately opposite the great doors through which he had entered, was a single, solitary chair. More like a throne, he thought. It was raised on a dais and had wide arms and a tall back. It was built of the same aged and smoothed stone as the rest of the room and, when Calor investigated more closely, even had the imprint of a seated man worn into the seat.</p>
<p>Calor looked around quickly, suddenly feeling as if he shouldn't be doing what he was about to do, and sat down quickly in the chair. He felt like a child surrounded by the great arms and the back that rose behind him above his head - not to mention that he had to lift himself up on to the seat so his feet were no longer touching the floor. But, it was comfortable and he relaxed, leaning back into the chair.</p>
<p>"Ah! Not bad for a seat made of rock! Not bad at all!"</p>
<p>A sly smile crossed his face and for several moments he forgot his current predicament and his entire reason for being there. He was filled with a satisfying mix of pride and arrogance, as if he'd won a mighty battle by sitting on that throne and was waiting for his courtiers to pay their respects. This feeling had barely begun before it was gone again and he was left feeling small, embarrassed and even more alone that before. Just a small man sat in a big chair, with not a soul to comfort him and not a friend in sight. With this sudden up-welling of self-pity, he pulled up his bare legs and curled up in the middle of the seat. He closed his eyes and hugged himself and for the first time in weeks - months even - he fell soundly asleep and knew no more.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>When he came to, it was to the sound of a shuffling and scuffling. As soon as he realised what he was hearing, he started and jumped out of the throne. He had become so accustomed to the silence of the place, that this new sound was threatening and dangerous. Beneath him, about halfway between himself and the wall of doorways, was a goat. It was licking at its side and was the source of all the noise.</p>
<p>"What the devil!", he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"How-how did you get in here?"</p>
<p>The goat looked up at the noise with an ambivalent and calm look on its face. It was clear that he was more frightened of the goat than the goat was of him. Before the goat had a chance to answer, however, something caught Calor's eye. In the doorway behind the goat, a figure seemed to be approaching the wall. It looked to be that of a young man and it was calling someone's name. Whoever he was, he was getting closer and closer to the doorway, until he seemed to be standing right outside the room. And then, with a small pop which made Calor jump out of his skin, the young man stepped through - out of the blue haze and in to the dull light of the low room.</p>
<p>Having stepped through from the prairie he had been strolling through into this dark, low chamber, the first thing he did was to raise his hand as if he was about to call out again and then stop. Confusion and fear crossed his face and he lowered his hand again. Then he caught sight of the goat.</p>
<p>"Millie!" he called and crossed over to the goat in two or three strides. Bending down onto one knee, he cradled his charge and then took stock of his surroundings.</p>
<p>The first thing he noticed, was the imposing figure in front of him, standing in front of an enormous stone throne. He was easily two metres tall and was a muscular and dangerous looking man. He was dressed in rags about his shoulders and waist, exposing his pale - almost translucent - blue skin stretched over thick muscles and powerful joints. He had a shaggy mane of albino hair and a short, unkempt beard. His eyes were wide, with rims of white surrounding pale, pink irises. His lips were red. More than his sudden dislocation from his fields to this strange room, the sight of this man put the fear of death into the young man and he cowered before him.</p>
<p>"Who- who the devil are you?" came the deep voice of the man in-front of the throne.</p>
<p>"I'm just, just, silly old me, I'm just Capra, humble shepherd and simple farmer, my Lord, I'm terribly sorry for interrupting your peace, your majesty, terribly sorry, terribly sorry!"</p>
<p>All these words tumbled out of him so fast that Calor could barely understand a word he said.</p>
<p>"Its alright, calm down my good man, calm down. Tell me where you're from- friend Capra."</p>
<p>"My Lord is merciful, very merciful, yes, thank ye, thank ye," and he dropped to the other knee and bowed fully forwards until his face touched the floor.</p>
<p>Calor wasn't quite sure what to do about this, so he said the only thing that felt right under the circumstances.</p>
<p>"You may rise, my child, now, tell me what you know."</p>
<p>"Why of course, of course!"</p>
<p>With this, Capra the humble shepherd launched into a tale of his farming life, in the distant province of Pratum. Every day was the same for him, tending his flock, working the fields, but today his favourite goat - Millie - had been missing at the end of the day and he'd set off in search of her. He'd been crossing the meadow where she normally grazed and had stumbled through this mysterious doorway and had ended up here.</p>
<p>"I just hope that my story is good enough for you, your majesty, 'cos I've not left out a single detail, I promise! I'll show you my farm if you like, if it would please you my Lord, or anything else you command, just let poor little Millie and I go free!"</p>
<p>This boy seemed to have an odd idea of what Calor might be about to do with him and the goat and Calor couldn't understand why he was so afraid. Apart from this rubbish about "my Lord" and "your Majesty", which Calor was going along with to be polite, they were quickly become fast friends - Calor thought.</p>
<p>"Very well, very well, good Capra, I believe you, and your home sounds like a pleasant and gentle place."</p>
<p>"It is, it is, my Lord!"</p>
<p>"And I may well take you up on your offer," Calor continued, "but I'm afraid to say that you may be trapped here now, just as I am!"</p>
<p>"Trapped? Oh no, please don't trap me here my Lord, I'll just be taking Millie home and I'll be out of your way!"</p>
<p>"Of course, my good Capra, you may go as you please...but if you find things not quite as you left them...well, you know where to find me."</p>
<p>"Yes my Lord, of course my Lord, thank ye, thank ye," grovelled Capra as he backed towards the door, tugging at Millie to follow him."</p>
<p>Calor smiled benevolently and watched as the young man retreated nervously to the doorway, pulling his goat through with a small pop. Almost as soon as he'd arrived, he was gone again. The smile on Calor's was frozen suddenly with the realisation that he'd just dismissed his only hope of company in this desolate place.</p>
<p>"Hope," he murmured to himself, "where is my hope now?"</p>
<p>He seated himself back on the throne and waited. He calmed himself and sat still. He waited.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Calor sat and he waited and he waited and he waited. His movements stilled, his breathing slowed and before long he looked like a silent statue carved out of the ice surrounding the fortress. He felt as if only moments were passing, but the truth was time was running through him like the neck of an hourglass. It could have been hours, it could have been days. He sat in the throne, staring out at the doorways to other worlds and waited. Silently, hopelessly, he waited.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Capra was frantic, running this way and that in the meadow. He had to escape this horror, he had to make things right, he had to find the King of that place again. Everyone he knew, everyone loved, frozen in a moment time - untouchable and unreachable, beyond help forever. He had to reach the King of that place again.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"-ere is it?!", cried Capra has he burst through the doorway, crashing to his knees panting and sobbing.</p>
<p>His sudden appearance, shook Calor out of his reverie and he stood suddenly out of the throne.</p>
<p>"My Lord, my Lord! What is this place? What has happened?"</p>
<p>"This? This is the Kingdom of Tharg, the home of misery and the centre of the sorcery of the Dark Mirror. It is her that has happened and I'm sorry it has happened to you. Welcome my brother, be welcome."</p>
