                <p>Aevum made his way over the flagship and Calir skipped after him with a renewed sense of energy that thirty minutes earlier he would have thought impossible. Sure enough on the port side, obscured from their previous vantage point, a small craft was suspended from frozen lines halfway lowered to the frozen sea below it. It was perfectly preserved like the stern of its mother-ship and was even complete with oars. After some struggling with the frozen ropes holding it fast (which was made considerably more difficult due to their reluctance to board the galleon itself), the pair managed to free the dinghy and drag it to the water's edge. Aevum held it steady in the peaceful waters, whilst Calir climbed aboard. The mage climbed in after him and they cast off. Within moments they were clear of the ice and, after about fifty yards or so, the entire frozen coastline began to disappear into a hazy sheen. By the time they'd covered two hundred yards, the flagship, the ice and the cursed continent beyond were all shrouded in a simple, white haze of cloud. The uninformed mariner would have no idea they were sailing so close to being caught in the snare of the Dark Mirror and neither would they know the risk of coming aground against the ice itself. It looked like a pleasant bank of cloud hovering over the sea, masking nothing more than the expanse of gentle, warm waves and still, pleasant air.</p>
<p>And so the two prisoners, travellers and companions rowed away from the Ice Continent. The frigid wasteland home to the Kingdom of Tharg, the Dark Mirror and their hidden, timeless prison cell was now behind them. Against all odds they had escaped and made their way back to the land of time and life, back to Calir's home: Domum Continent. But, even in the relief of their freedom, Calir could not help casting his mind back to the brother he had left abandoned behind him. He was sure that–even at this very moment–poor Placor was suffering terribly. He had never been a man of action or of violence and would be at the mercy of Tharg and his men. And, deeper down, he couldn't help feeling that something was wrong about their escape; something was wrong about this homecoming. The path in the mountains that he had somehow strayed from all those days ago seemed far removed from their present situation. Only time would tell now. However, with each oar stroke they were closer to home and, smothering all of his feelings of disquiet, he couldn't help feeling an overwhelming sense of deliverance from the horrors of the Dark Mirror.</p>
<p>Aevum stared ahead implacably. He pulled on his oar, but said nothing more.</p>
