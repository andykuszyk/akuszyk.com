            <div class="col-lg"><p>"How long? How long. Time does not matter here, newcomer, it is not a thing to be measured with words like â€˜long'. Time is in the Dark Mirror, and the Dark Mirror is in time. As for a way out? Yes, yes, there is a way out. Impossible for one, but with two? Perhaps."</p>
<p>"My goodness! Do you mean to say that you've been trapped here for who knows how long, tormented by the knowledge of a way to escape, but lacking only a fellow prisoner to execute your plan?"</p>
<p>"It is no hardship on my part, newcomer. I came here to wait, if waiting you can call it. I have been expecting you and I came here in expectation of you. Welcome, be welcome."</p>
<p>These last words sent a fresh shiver down Calir's spine. This odd little man had been expecting him? Had Tharg known of their arrival in advance? Had he warned him? Was this prisoner responsible for their straying into the Ice Kingdom? It was enough to make poor Calir's head spin. He shook his head and promptly sat down in the middle of the room, where he'd found himself sprawled out a few minutes earlier, and faced the bundle of clothes expounding upon his predicament so confoundingly.</p>
<p>"Calir. My name is Calir, my good man. And yours is?"</p>
<p>"Aevum."</p>
<p>"Well, er, nice to meet you my good, er, Aevum. May we forever be friends and never be enemies."</p>
<p>Aevum stared back in silence.</p>
<p>"That's what we say where I come from, when we meet someone new. It means, let's start off by being friends and thinking the best of one another and try to get along. A wise idea for the two of us, eh?"</p>
<p>He chuckled as he spoke, trying to illicit the same from the stoney face of Aevum.</p>
