        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-lg"><p>"So my magical friend, since we are to be joined in this quest I shall give you the dubious honour of deciding on our initial path. Which way to Domum, oh mage of great power?"</p>
<p>The mage missed the sarcasm in Calir's voice, which was lucky for Calir.</p>
<p>"You do us both a great service to leave this decision up to me. A mage is never lost and I, for one, happen to know precisely where we are. Domum you say? The continent of your home is...this way!"</p>
<p>Aevum pointed to his right and slightly behind him and, without waiting to see if Calir would follow him, stalked away into the snow. Calir hesitated for a moment. After all, he was only being polite by suggesting that the mage should choose their direction of travel. But, after all, if the mage knew something about this region that was more than Calir. If he had been lost before when he had stumbled into Tharg's den, he was utterly astray now. At least, with the palace of Tharg, they had slowly wandered into that hostile and alien landscape. Now, he had found himself suddenly and incomprehensibly in the middle of an Arctic ice field unlike anything he had seen before. It was even different from Tharg's kingdom, if that was possible. Ice beyond ice with no friendly - yet deceiving - fortresses in sight. Yes, Aevum was right to take the initiative and Calir would be a fool not to follow him. With this realisation, Calir hastened to catch up with the mage who was already almost out of sight in the near-blizzard of the swirling ice and snow. He ran after him and tried to keep pace.</p>
<p>So began the long trek of Calir and Aevum across the glacial planes of the Ice Continent. Little did Calir know at the time, but there were still very much in the territory claimed by Tharg. Indeed, they had been released by the Dark Mirror not all that far from Tharg's palace itself. But, the mage said nothing of this - whether he knew it or not - and he and Calir trudged on in ignorance of their proximity to the site of Calir's capture. With the mountains to the West and the icy expanse of the Ice Continent stretching away to the North, an untrained observer would question the mage's choice of heading East. However, for better or worse, he knew of an ancient and mysterious bridge from the Ice Continent back to Domum. Objectively, Domum Continent was off to the West, South of the mountains. However, in this land twisted by magic and stitched together with sorcery, East to the sea and beyond was the only path back to the South and West. Thus, Aevum led the beguiled Calir off across the ice sheets until, after many days of frigid marching they reached the sea.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"Honestly my good man, will this devilry never end?"</p>
<p>"I told you, friend Calir, the further we are from the influence of the Dark Mirror, the less you will feel its effects. By the time we return to your own land, your hunger will be your own again."</p>
<p>"So you keep saying, but I cannot get used to this. First we were frozen in time with no appetite or sleep, and now we're frozen again you say, but this time with hunger! I say, what a hellish position to find oneself in. Hungry with no need of food. Tired with no need of sleep. Yet this abominable cold and no way to keep warm. Couldn't she have made us immune to that?"</p>
<p>Aevum sighed. After a few days of listening to Calir's good natured yet irritating complaints, he was starting to weary of the fellow's company. Still, he had promised to help the man reach his homeland and a mage didn't rescind his word simply because his companion wouldn't stop extolling his.</p>
