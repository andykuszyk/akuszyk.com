                <p>"Ah ha! This must be it...yes, I'm sure of it. Well, come on then my good man, fortune favours the bold!"</p>
<p>Jogging off into the tunnel, he left Aevum in his wake to follow in a more dignified manner. Aevum wasn't sure what to expect from the interior, but he was certain it would not be what Calir was expecting. The magic of the Dark Mirror did not work in ways that could easily be understood by mortals, and Calir's measure of their situation simply felt too good to be true. The mage was on his guard.</p>
<p>When Aevum caught up with Calir in a large chamber into which the entrance tunnel emerged, he found the man looking around slightly lost.</p>
<p>"I was expecting to find him here–this is where I left him!"</p>
<p>"That was several weeks ago, for us my friend. Even for them that must have been several hours–days even. Courage, friend Calir, it is with evil sorcery that we now contend."</p>
<p>Calir nodded his head knowingly and looked around once more. They were in wide, tall, square chamber. There was a wall of sorts half way across, which reached about a third of the way to the ceiling. There was a stone balustrade across its rim and a small doorway half way along its base.</p>
<p>"Ah! That's where Tharg came from, it's where they took me!" he called over his shoulder with excitement, as he started walking towards it.</p>
<p>Reaching the doorway, which was open and without obstruction, he saw a line of steps leading up–he remembered being carried up these, his feet banging against each step as his tormentors dragged him up. Throwing caution to the wind, he jumped up these two at a time, with the mage barely keeping up behind him. He gained the mezzanine level and glanced around. A few yards behind him was the balustrade with a view opening out onto the rest of the chamber. Ahead of him was a broad square that had the feel of a courtyard to it, except that it was covered by the vaulted ceiling and devoid of any plant life. Down each side ran a set of cloisters and on the back wall was a large, ornate door frame, easily ten feet tall. From this distance, he couldn't make out much of the detail, but it seemed to be covered in carvings or statues. It was hung with a pair of giant oaken doors, gilt with iron fastenings. And, between him and this doorway there was a spot where the air seemed to shimmer and the floor was different. He paused and listened. Apart from the sound of Aevum patting up the steps behind him, there was silence. No voices, no raucous laughter, no screams of torture. Still, he thought, that must make sense. For the inhabitants of Tharg's palace, it would take a day to utter a single syllable. Of course he couldn't hear anything, he reassured himself.</p>
<p>"Well?", the mage had joined him.</p>
<p>"Nothing yet, lets investigate that," he nodded towards the shimmering air between them and the back wall.</p>
