                <p>"Phew, it's snowing!"</p>
<p>"Mercy me, it's freezing!"</p>
<p>"What's happened to the weather!"</p>
<p>"Let's move along", Calir asserted, sounding more certain than he felt. "We'd best be off–the sooner we're off, the sooner we're home."</p>
<p>It didn't take much cajoling to get up and about and before long they were trudging down the path, stamping their feet and blowing into their hands. Except, the path was no longer leading down. In fact, it was leading back up. And, rather than descending into quiet woodland amongst dappled light, they were ascending into a fractured ice field, bare and bright in the eery light of the clear night sky. All around were ice-blues and glistening-silvers as they began to be surrounded by teeth of ice shooting this way and that. They huddled closer together and kept going, but were quiet now, each nursing his own fears about where they might have gone wrong and when they might turn round. Calir was wracked with feelings of doubt about their way back home. He'd been covering the same route in the mountains for years now and often wandered in the hills by himself when he was feeling restless or wanted to escape the confines of home. Never in his wildest imaginations, let alone his living experience, had he ever seen a land so desolate and hostile as this. This ice-continent was barren and unwelcoming in a way that Domum was fertile and embracing.</p>
<p>They stopped once or twice. First to don their warmer clothes–shawls, cloaks and the like. Second to wrap themselves in their night-time blankets, re-buckling their belts around the outside and stretching the tops over their heads like ill-fitted cloaks. Their toes were numb and their hands blue. They trudged on in silence and fear, wondering where they'd end up and how they'd get home.</p>
<p>Just as Calir was considering turning back and trying to re-trace their steps back out of this ice-land and onto the mountain, he spotted a sheen of yellow amongst the desert of pale blue. He started forward with a renewed energy and saw that it was a tall, sandstone wall rising over the false-horizon of a nearby serac. Calir was more excited than surprised–or suspicious–to see such an unlikely feature in the icy wasteland. He was simply relieved to find a break to the rising tension of the frozen landscape and eager to find a sign that might indicate the end of this hideous detour into the unwelcoming ice.</p>
<p>"Come on Plac, up ahead! Looks like an old fort of some kind. Maybe we just got lost coming down the mountain!"</p>
<p>Calir's words were the first that had been uttered between them for many hours and they shattered the silence like an icicle falling to the ground. They hurried forward and, when the wall came fully into view, headed for the large, open door at the base. As they approached and passed through the opening, it turned out to be less of a door and more of a tunnel through the outer wall. Much like a drawbridge of old, it had a large, spiked, iron portcullis raised into the ceiling, until only the bottom protrusions were revealed. The tunnel led inside into a large hall with a vaulted stone ceiling. Tall, cathedral-like windows down either side of the hall let the pale, icy light in, but with none of its chill. The sand-coloured walls lent their warmth to the light, turning it yellow with a cheer that one could almost believe. They felt the rise in temperature, accompanied by a rise in their spirits, when they stepped into the hall. They spread out, shrugged off their outer blankets and looked around.</p>
<p>"Wow, look at this place! Its huge!"</p>
