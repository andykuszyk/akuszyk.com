            <div class="col-lg"><p>"At least it's warmer in here than out there!"</p>
<p>As soon as the group of friends spread out into the room, they relaxed and assumed their previous airs of cheerful optimism and good-natured friendliness. They wandered this way and that, stamping their feet and rubbing their hands as they warmed up in the hall, almost as if the golden light had the power to thaw their frozen limbs. Calir shared the general feeling of relief, but not to the point of abandon. He was still worried that they were a long way off course - even further from home - and had a niggling doubt about this oasis of shelter in the desert of ice without. There was something about it that was just too good to be true. It had been there right when they were reaching the limits of their endurance, right when they needed it - right when they were ready to turn around. He walked further into the hall, looking about him with more caution than wonder. The hall opened out into a roughly rectangular space, wider than it was deep. Calir was crossing the midpoint towards the opposite wall, which seemed to be a mezzanine level of some kind. There was a balustrade running along its top below the still significant rise to the vaulted ceilings above. A small doorway opened in the middle of this inner wall, behind which he could see the first few steps of a rising stairwell. A stairwell which presumably led to the higher floor and out onto the mezzanine. Calir had just determined to climb the stair so as to gain a better vantage of the fortress they found themselves in, when he was stopped dead in his tracks. His heart leapt in his chest, and the bottom fell out of his stomach. His already pale face turned to a picture of ice and his mind turned to the worst.</p>
<p>The sound of laughter broke into the warm echoes of the hall, dousing the idle chatter of the group with a draft of chill air. It was the sound of a predator closing in on his prey and taking amusement in doing so. Except that the laughter was akin to that of a hyena, and the hyena is no predator. The hyena is a scavenger and so was the man that appeared at the edge of the balustrade, looking down from atop the mezzanine at the folk scattered here and there, with Calir foremost amongst them. He was dressed in a ragged shirt of torn linen, with scraps of animal fur about him here and there. A rough belt of leather was slung about one shoulder and a loose loin cloth hung around his waist. His arms and legs were bare, as was much of his chest, displaying a muscular frame bound in ice-cold skin. His skin appeared ice-cold, because of its colour - a pale blue of deep, clear ice. His dishevelled hair and beard were pale to the point of albino. Even his lips appeared blue. The only colour about him, which betrayed his membership of the warm-blooded races, was in his tongue, which flicked and lolled as he spoke. It was a deep, blood red. Deeper than the blood that surely must have flowed through his veins. It was the red of old blood; of dead blood; of blood shed.</p>
<p>Silence reigned: every man in the room stopped and stared at this intruder to their peace, this claimant of their joy. The laughter trailed off and came to a stop. The man stood still, surveying the group with a easy, sly smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Well, well, well, what do we have here my boys, what do we have here..."</p>
<p>His smile deepened into a grin and his eyes came to rest on Calir. Calir's gaze was already locked onto this pale omen of frozen death. He couldn't look away. He could feel the eyes of the others glancing against him side-long, snatched away from the man above furtively in case he noticed. They were all expecting him to do something. Anything.</p>
<p>"Er, well," he cleared his through, "hello there, my good man, er, how do you do? Rather cold here isn't it?"</p>
<p>Calir gave a single, fearful chuckle that was not repeated or returned by anyone, and continued.</p>
<p>"We were just looking for our way home, actually, we're heading back to Domum Continent. I don't suppose you or your, er, boys could set us on the right path, could you?"</p>
<p>Silence prevailed now as all eyes fell on the figure leaning over the balustrade. The smile seemed to wane about his lips and his eyes grew colder still.</p>
