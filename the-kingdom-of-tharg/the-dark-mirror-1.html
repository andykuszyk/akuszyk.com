                <p>Calir's screams eventually gave out. When they did, he found himself relaxing slightly. He was falling and falling and falling, but he couldn't feel it any more. The sick lurch of his stomach, the thrill of his heart and the feeling of impending death had left him, replaced with numb realisation that he was falling from life. All he could feel now was the frigid rush of air past his face and the slow tumble of his body. He could see nothing, neither wall nor sky nor floor. Blind and frozen, he was falling into the bowels of this mysterious ice continent towards who knew what. Tharg's last cryptic words about the magic of this Dark Mirror were completely lost on Calir, whose simple mind could only think of the warm, golden fields of wheat and the merry ale houses of home. He was stunned into silence and remission by the endless wail of frozen air numbing his face and his body, his mind and his soul. He was lost in an endless fall from life to death, from light to dark and from the time of friendship and love to a time of loneliness and eternal isolation. He was lost.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of falling, during which Calir found himself waking with a start more than once, a sensation in his gut told him that he was slowing. Against all expectations, he was being brought to rest rather than falling to his demise. Up ahead of him - or, rather, down below him - a faint postage stamp of dim light could be made out. Calir wasn't quite sure what he could see, but it looked like a dim circle of midnight blue growing as he fell. Soon it was the size of his palm, then two palms. Before long, he could see the disc widening, except now it wasn't widening - he was falling slowly towards it and it was getting closer.</p>
<p>He could make it out now. It was a disc of subtle, midnight blue. The light was rising from the disc like mist from a cold, dawn lake. It shimmered and shifted like a mystic ether evapourating into the darkness. From the looks of things, it was about ten metres across and was slightly concave - a shallow bowl of light. As far as he could tell, Calir was hovering about three or four metres above the disc's surface, gently descending now. He figured he'd probably land on it in the next few minutes.</p>
<p>"So, you must be the Dark Mirror that the mighty King Tharg was so afraid of, I suppose?", he murmured to the darkness.</p>
<p>The Mirror returned no answer and remained enigmatic in its silence. Calir was now a metre above it. He could almost feel the ethereal light brushing past his skin.</p>
<p>"What happens when I touch you?"</p>
<p>Calir was whispering now. The Mirror was impassive.</p>
<p>Centimetres to go now. If he'd been able, Calir would have reached forward and touched the surface of the Mirror, but some invisible force was holding him prone. He closed his eyes and held his breath. Any moment now.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>Calir awoke with a start. He was laying face down on a cold, hard surface. It was slightly gritty and, as he raised his head, he could feel particles of dirt and sand sticking to his skin. He'd been laying there for a while. His entire body was cold from lying against the stone for so long - he groaned as he slowly picked himself up into a kneeling position. Looking around, he found himself in a circular room built of the same sandy stone as in Tharg's palace. Big blocks lined the walls and the floor was covered in flagstones of the same material. The walls gently arched upwards to form a domed ceiling. There were no doors. No windows. The room was sealed and Calir could see no way in through which he had arrived and no way out through which he could escape. He was in a cocooned prison cell. It took a few moments for Calir to realise that there was no light either - there was no source of light, yet the entire room seemed to be bathed in the golden, homely light of the stone below and the palace above.</p>
