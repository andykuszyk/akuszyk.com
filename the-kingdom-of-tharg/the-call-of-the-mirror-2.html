<p><hr></p>
<p>"Well, that was the last one!" announced Calir gaily, as they walked past the final galleon before the shore.</p>
<p>Ahead of them rose the ice sheets of Tharg's kingdom. Jagged blades of ice jutting out of the calm, glassy surface of the sea, rising to form the ice continent. It was like something from a nightmare, except Calir had forgotten and now found himself eager to return.</p>
<p>"I'm eager to find my friends", he told himself, "I want to see them safely back to Domum, safely back home." He repeated this to himself like a mantra, but the truth was that he was excited to return to Tharg's palace. He wouldn't admit it to himself, and he didn't know why, but part of him was excited to see it again. It held an allure in his mind that could not be explained, nor denied.</p>
<p>"I shall lead us from now, friend Calir."</p>
<p>Aevum stepped forwards, gazing towards the fractured landscape of ice rising before them.</p>
<p>"It will take all of our skill and more than a little luck to navigate the mysterious interior of this continent. But! Fear not! A dark mage of my power and experience is a match for this challenge. We shall prevail. I shall return you to your friends."</p>
<p>"I have every faith in you, my good man. You've not failed me yet and I don't expect you to now-"</p>
<p>"However, when re-united you are, then I must leave you."</p>
