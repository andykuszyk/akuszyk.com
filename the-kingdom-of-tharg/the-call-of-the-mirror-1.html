                <p>Their little vessel bumped up against the icy shore like a toy boat. The humidity rising from the water had Calir sweating, even in just his tunic and breeches, so the cool air wafting off the ice was a welcome relief. He inhaled.</p>
<p>"Ah, smell that cool, crisp air, my good man! Hate to say it, but I believe I missed the clarity of it. The...freshness. Something pure about it, wouldn't you say?"</p>
<p>"It is the air of the realm of the Dark Mirror and the smell of the Kingdom of Tharg. I am not as welcoming of it as you, friend Calir, and you would do well to remember the perils we are walking back into."</p>
<p>"Just trying to look on the bright side, my good fellow, just trying to keep the old spirits up. Danger and darkness it might hold, but, truth be told, I was starting to feel a bit smothered by the thick air back there. Its not quite what I remembered, I have to say. Must be a heavier climate...further South..."</p>
<p>Calir trailed off, looking slightly puzzled. He couldn't quite reconcile his feeling of relief at having gained landfall at the Ice Continent again. He ought be filled with dread. But, at most, all he felt was mild trepidation. Aevum stepped ashore, which knocked Calir out of his reverie. They scraped the small craft inland far enough that it was well away from the water's edge - just in case they needed to return this way - and then looked around to get their bearings. Off to their left, further away than when last they saw it, was the half-wreck of the leading galleon. The bow was still a rotting husk, more hole than plank, slowly collapsing into the virulent sea. The stern was still a frozen moment of majesty, speaking of pride and beauty and excellence, apart from its ragged sails and torn flags.</p>
<p>"Do you remember the way back, friend Calir?"</p>
<p>"I do, I do! Follow the ships until the ice rises up into the glaciers and then - trust to our instincts I suppose!"</p>
<p>"Indeed. I can probably help us there, friend Calir. You lead us to the ice and then we shall see if the Dark Mirror's ethereal sorcery leads us back to Tharg."</p>
<p>Calir paused for a moment to consider this. Then, deciding that he didn't understand it and didn't need to, he strode off towards the next ship, stuck in the ice on the horizon. Aevum watched the fellow walk away purposefully, filled with an energy that you might never have thought would animate him again, had you seen him two days earlier on this same stretch of frozen sea. A slight frown crossed the mage's face as his eyes flicked down to the bundle of material at this feet. Cloaks and shawls with a heavy belt and a pair of thick leather boots. All of these Calir had been wearing when Aevum had first encountered him in the sealed cell in the bowels of the Dark Mirror. All of them Calir had shed when they had returned to the warmer climes of Domum. And, all of them Calir had carried with him in their little dinghy, with the intention of donning them again when they reached the ice. But, now, he was striding away bare-footed and open-chested, wearing nothing but his cotton shirt and linen breeches. Just days before, he was grumbling perpetually about the cold and the wind. Now, he didn't seem to notice either. Aevum had a deep sense of foreboding about this. It was normal for a mage of his power to remain unaffected by the shifting temperatures of the material world about him. He had been as comfortable in the tropical heat of Domum as he was now in the freezing cold of the ice. He wore his robes and cloaks either way, unperturbed. But Calir - he was a simple man of a simple people. His kind didn't walk about on the frozen sea of Gelida in nothing but their skin unless they were crazed beyond belief, or imbued with some dark sorcery. As eccentric as the fellow was, Aevum feared that it was the latter and that fear furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>"What devilry do we face now? The Dark Mirror follows us still..."</p>
