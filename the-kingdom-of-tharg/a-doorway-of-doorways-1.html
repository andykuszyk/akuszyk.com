                <p>Silence prevailed. The eternal exhale from the void of The Mirror seemed to hold its breath. Calir let out a singular sob. Without Aevum he was utterly alone, friendless and hopelessly lost. What could he possibly accomplish without the Mage's guidance? It was Aevum who had led them here. Aevum who had worked out what was happening to them. Aevum who had guided them safely across the Gelida sea. Aevum who had rescued them from the catacombs of the Dark Mirror. Without Aevum, Calir realised, he would still be a prisoner in that cell without windows or doors. He would still be buried alive. He sniffed and wiped his eyes.</p>
<p>"Don't lose yourself yet, my good man, don't lose yourself just yet. There are still folks who need you - your friends are still out there."</p>
<p>He stared into the opening with a drawn look of despair on his face, before catching himself and forcing a wry smile onto his lips.</p>
<p>"And don't forget the last words of the Mage - hope! Its hope that's the bane of Her magic, so hope we must have!"</p>
<p>His words echoed hollowly in the wide, open hall and he shivered. His skin was still warm, despite the rags he was wearing, but he felt chilled to the bone.</p>
<p>"Come on, my man, what's through there? Got to keep going!"</p>
<p>He was pointing towards the large archway ahead that he had spotted when he'd first looked past the shimmering haze of the mirror. More out of the need to do something than to follow any vestige of curiosity, he moved around the circumference of the Mirror and made his way across the hall to far wall. The closer he got to the archway - which was easily three or four metres high and two across - the more he noticed how ornate it was. The hall itself was built out of simple, flat blocks of stone with no adornment or pattern. But the doorway was intricately decorated and was covered in small sculptures and carvings. They depicted all sorts of scenes - a farmer ploughing a field, a warrior slaying his adversary, a water god rising out of the waves. Next to the bare, plain walls of the hall around it, the doorway was a cacophony of imagery. The doors were the same, now he had gotten closer. They were crafted from giant oaken beams bolted together with thick plates of iron, but they had been carved and sculpted until you could hardly see the grain of the wood at all. Even the iron had patterns and pictures engraved in it, so that you couldn't look at a single point on the whole door or frame without seeing some kind of scene depicted.</p>
<p>When he was standing in front of the doors, he saw that they were very closely fitted into the frame and were shut tight. From looking at them, he would have thought they were locked fast and that there was no way through, but he tried them anyway. To his surprise, with each palm on either door, they gave easily and swung silently and smoothly inwards. They were perfectly balanced such that the lightest touch moved them ever-so-slightly inwards. He leant forwards slightly and they opened enough for him to walk through onto the threshold.</p>
<p>On the other side of the doors was another room that, whilst still large, was much smaller than the hall he had come from. Unlike the hall, it wasn't illuminated by shining yellow stone and large, open window frames, but was dull and dark. Not dark like a dungeon, but dark like a bedroom at night with a single candle burning. Except, instead of the warm orange glow of a candle, there was a pale shimmer of blue. The blue had an ethereal quality to it that didn't make Calir think of the ice outside, but instead had him imagining that the light was somehow filtering down from the surface of a shallow, warm sea and into the room. Unlike the boundary of the Mirror, where he felt a deep sense of unease and dread, here he felt oddly calm and at home. So, without a hint of the fear he had felt not five minutes previously, he stepped forward and through the doorway.</p>
