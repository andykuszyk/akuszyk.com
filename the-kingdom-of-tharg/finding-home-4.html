                <p>"Very well my good man," he replied, sounding somewhat more like his former self, "if two more days are required of me to reach my home, I shall take it. I thank you for your guidance and protection, but beyond the stretch of those days I feel that I shall surely perish from cold, desperation and despair. Let us be gone from this place and find this dark crossing of yours."</p>
<p><hr></p>
<p>"The Gelida sea!"</p>
<p>Aevum pointed far out to the horizon, across the smooth, white sheet of ice that was the only sign that they'd reached the coast. The sky was still a dark, steely grey above them. But, out towards the horizon it seemed to lighten slightly and you could almost imagine the sun shining somewhere out there, warming the ice to become gently lapping waves. The most curious feature of the frozen sea was the crossing that Aevum had led them to. Not far from the shore was an enormous, wooden galleon ship. It was glued into the ice at an unnatural angle, with chains and ropes trailing from it into the frozen water. It was if it had been sailing out of the bay and had been caught in a sudden permafrost, frozen into the unchanging landscape of the sea to become a permanent moment of pitching and yawing. It had an eery look to it, for whilst the ropes and lines were preserved in positions of life, the sails were torn and ragged, flapping sadly in the cold breeze. The only moving parts of the ships were these remnants of a past that had, in all other ways, been preserved on the ship.</p>
<p>"And that," he moved his arm in the direction of the galleon, "is the beginning of the bridge across the ice."</p>
<p>"The ship?"</p>
<p>"The ship. If you look further out, there is another, and another. They stretch all the way out to the ice barrier between the Ice Continent and the place you call home."</p>
<p>"Extraordinary! It's like a graveyard for ships! But why do we need them? Surely we can just walk across the ice?"</p>
<p>"We will need them before the end. The further we get from these shores, the more we will require food, sleep and shelter. The Gelida sea is utterly barren, even more so than the continent we have just crossed. And, eventually, when we reach the edge of the sea–when it thaws into the milder waters you're used to–we'll need a vessel in which to cross the final stretch. This place is the only place where we can cross the sea with all of these things that we need. It was created in ages past, whether by design or some strange sea-battle no-one knows. But, it is here now and we will use it."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course my good man, I wasn't questioning your guidance for a single moment! Didn't you say something earlier about danger? Not for us, of course, but for those vulnerable travellers not aided by a mage of your power and experience?"</p>
