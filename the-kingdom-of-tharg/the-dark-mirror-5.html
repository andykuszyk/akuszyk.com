                <p>"Learn?"</p>
<p>"Mmm, learn of the dark magic that binds this place, learn some of the dark lore that I possess. Only with this knowledge will you be able to assist me in making a portal."</p>
<p>"A portal where? Can we go back to Domum?"</p>
<p>"Domum? I am unfamiliar with that place."</p>
<p>"Well! Not heard of Domum? What kind of mage do you call yourself?"</p>
<p>"A Dark one."</p>
<p>Calir paused briefly, evaluating the ominous expression on the mage's face, before carrying on lightly.</p>
<p>"Domum is my home continent–where my brother and I are from–filled with small townships, green pastures and gentle rivers. Its warm in the Summers, mild in the Winters and a joy in the Spring! I've lived there all my life, apart from these short forays into the mountains - none of which have gone awry until now I should say - and would dearly love to get back there. No more of this ice and cold, Dark Magic and cocooned prison cells. Just warm evenings, good mead and hearty suppers. You'll like it there Aevum, it will put some colour on your cheeks and some meat on your bones! You'll be a different man there, I promise. It makes the best of everyone! Not like this place. This place seems to bring out the worst, especially of that bully Tharg and his cronies."</p>
<p>A shiver ran down Calir's spine as he recalled the recent past and his current predicament. He had almost forgotten himself in his recollections of home. But, all of a sudden, he found himself cold and shivering against the stone-cold floor. He got up stiffly and stamped his feet, rubbing his arms.</p>
<p>"Anywhere my good man, let's just get this over with and get anywhere but here. Then, I'm sure we can find our way back home. My sense of direction (never failed me before now), and your resourcefulness. We'll be back to Domum continent in a jiffy. Of course, we'll have to rescue poor Placor first. Let's just escape from this awful place, rescue young Plac and put as much distance between us and Tharg as possible!"</p>
